While I enjoyed the game thoroughly, I eventually caved in and bought this title for the Nintendo console, never once looking back or regretting my decision.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>As a side-scrolling platformer, it captured the heart and soul of <a href=#>Batman: The Animated Series</a> through its clever level and puzzle designs, as well as by harnessing and maximizing the console’s graphic power. Even to this day, the game still looks good in comparison to others from that era, and you could easily get lost in its world for hours.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>It might not be the juggernaut that the Arkham series is today, but this was definitely many people’s favorite <a href=#>Batman</a> game for a long time, including mine. I mean, you got to battle Catwoman while falling down from the rooftops. If that’s not awesome, I don’t know what is.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Maximum Carnage</strong></h2><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/maximum-carnage-638x360.jpg alt width=638 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>In the 90s, <a href=#>Spider-Man</a> and <a href=#>Venom</a> were two of the most popular characters around. Naturally, when a video game starring the two Web-Heads came out, the comic book and video game communities lost their collective mind. Playing as Spidey and Venom in a gaming adaption of Maximum Carnage? TAKE MY MONEY!</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>As a side-scrolling beat ’em up, you’d have the chance to play as either character at certain points in the game while attempting to stop Carnage’s killing spree. Additionally, other characters from the Marvel universe were made available for you to use as power-ups. So, not only could you beat the pulp out of bad guys, but you could summon the likes of Cloak and Dagger to clean the villains’ clocks as well. Cool, right?</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>Lest we forget, the bad-to-the-bone soundtrack came to us courtesy of the alternative rock band Green Jellÿ, who recorded the greatest song in the history of mankind, “Three Little Pigs.” No, this isn’t up for debate: it’s the greatest song and that’s final.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles In Time</strong></h2><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-4-turtles-in-time-640x360.jpg alt width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Originally released for the arcades and ported to the console, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time is not only the best Turtles game around, but possibly the best side-scroller as well. Many friendships and bonds were cemented through the co-op mode, where you and your bestie would take on the Shredder’s numerous challenges and Foot Soldiers.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>While the first arcade game might be remembered more fondly due to it being released at the height of TMNT-mania, this sequel took the scenery and action to the next level. No longer were you confined to the streets of New York, but the adventures reached further and wider.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, many people still think this game was an adaptation of the horrendous 1993 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, which also involved the Turtles going back in time to battle who-knows-what, but they really have nothing in common apart from the time-travel element. Trust me here, skip the film and play the game instead. It’s far more rewarding.</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>2</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>4</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>5</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>6</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>7</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>8</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>9</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoaGllkprAtXnSrqeeqpiav7B51aKbnqddnK6usdJmqqedo2R%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
