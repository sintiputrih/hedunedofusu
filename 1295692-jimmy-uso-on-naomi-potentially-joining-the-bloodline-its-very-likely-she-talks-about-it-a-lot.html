“It’s very, very likely, man,” Jimmy Uso said during an appearance on WWE After The Bell with Corey Graves. “She talks about it a lot."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She talks about it like damn, I got an idea, I could drop the glow, I’m ready to just snap. And she could snap, man. She snapped on my ass many times so she can bring that in promos, man, she’s so ready to try something new. You know, she’s always been adaptive to, she gets it.”</p><p>Uso went on to say that sometimes, he forgets that Naomi has also been around the professional wrestling world for a decade, and that he can tell that Naomi is itching to joining the faction sooner rather than later.</p><p>“That’s why she’s been around, sometimes I forget she’s been here ten years, too,” Uso said. “She’s been right there, right when the first NXT started, she was on the road. When we debuted, you know the girls had the first NXT show. So she was on the road. When we went on the road, she was on the road. She came different, but I forget too. She’s like, ‘It’s about time I gotta jump in this bloodline and I need to start snapping,’ you know what I’m saying? I’d like to have it. She talks about it a lot. Even Heyman touched on it too.”</p><p>Naomi currently holds the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship with Sasha Banks; the duo successfully defended the titles against Shayna Baszler and Natalya on the May 13 episode of WWE SmackDown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFybG9xYmK3qrnMsmSuq59ivK95zZqmpqFdpby1sc2toJqknK56q7vIp6Cnn12ptaZ5waWmqJycnrumecitqmaulafGbrjIpJylsV2otaZ505qjpKtdlq%2BwwdNmoK1lkWK5sMA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
