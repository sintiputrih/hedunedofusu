When he got the call, he cleaned out his locker and never looked back. He was main-eventing PPVs while other NXT Superstars were being called up. They were hungry, but after a while, things changed. The current NXT locker room does nothing but play around on their phones and act entitled. Corbin built this place. He came through the doors tonight, and the superstars in the back can’t even look him in the eyes.</p><p>Corbin is going to make everyone here regret ever signing a WWE contract. Every single one of them is soft and weak. The NXT Champion Carmelo Hayes walks around like his stuff doesn’t stink. Hayes got a dose of main roster reality last week when Corbin took him out. Ilja Dragonuv interrupts. Dragonuv introduces himself to Corbin. Corbin says he knows who he is and wants to know what he wants. Dragonuv came out to look Corbin in the eye and tell him he isn’t soft or weak. He’s the first person in line to face Carmelo Hayes for the NXT Championship. Corbin says this is that “NXT entitlement.”</p><h4 id=h-check-out-last-week-s-coverage-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-23-gigi-dolin-vs-jacy-jayne-mystery-attacker-revealed>Check Out Last Week’s Coverage: <a href=#>WWE NXT Results (5/30/23): Gigi Dolin vs. Jacy Jayne, Mystery Attacker Revealed</a></h4><p>He’s wrestled at WrestleMania six times. Dragonuv doesn’t care. Corbin says he jumped the line because he could. Dragonuv challenges Corbin to a match tonight. Corbin asks if Dragonuv really wants a match after what happened to him at Battleground. Dragonuv lifts up his shirt and reveals a nasty bruise. Dragonuv says there is nothing Corbin can do to him. Corbin retorts that it’s a cute little bruise, but when he is done with Dragonuv, his body will be covered in them. Dragonuv leaves the ring. Trick Williams attacks Corbin from behind. Williams clotheslines Corbin over the top rope.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h4>The Creed Brother and Ivy Nile vs. The Dyad and Ava Rayne</h4><p>Fowler drives Julius into the corner.
