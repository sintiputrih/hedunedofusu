Joe will be in action on the August 17 episode of ROH TV, as he’ll team with Stokely Hathaway against Dalton Castle’s Boys. After that, Joe will be headed to London as he recently challenged CM Punk for a match at the All In event.</p><h2 id=h-dream-match>Dream Match</h2><p>Shane Taylor has been looking for a match with Joe for quite some time. He&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sportskeeda</a>‘s Dr. Chris Featherstone that Joe would be a dream match.</p><p>“Number one is Samoa Joe,” Shane Taylor said. “Stylistically, I feel like I’ve always been… My run in Ring of Honor with the TV Title is similar to his run with the world title. He held it much longer, but there’s something about going to battle with someone who’s not out here trying to be the best catch as catch can, technical, five-star wrestler.</p><p>“You have guys that do that. I’m here to square up and punch you in the face. [Let’s] see who’s really about that life, who’s really gonna stand there and go toe to toe and fire those things off. When you look at Joe, when you watch what he does, he’s got such a mix of every kind of style. But when you really see him at his best, it’s when people push him to do that. When they bring that savage Joe out, Joey Head-Rocker, that’s the guy that I want to fight. So Joe would be up there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJya25vYWLAqa3NnmStmamhvLN51qKlrGWVobautc2aq6iqXam8tr7NmqSepqRisqK%2Bzaxkq6eYYsG3edOiq6WdXai1sMCMmp6aoZ6owW6%2FwKammmWapLI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
