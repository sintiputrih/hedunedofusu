I'm taking the "biological" route.<p>When it comes to "women" - life begins in our bodies (even though we need sperm), so we need "some" sort of emotional connection with a guy in order to have sex with him because in the event we get pregnant, we want and/or need the guy to be around.</p><p>Now, whether or not that emotional connection was for a few hours or and/or based on nothing good (i.e. women in abusive situations, a ONS), fact is, the women felt "something". Yes, there are women who are capable of having sex w/o emotions - but they're the exception, not the rule, and often are "damaged" in some way.</p><p>I think there are men that need an emotional connection - but still can "compartmentalize" sex and love. My last FWB was 42. He was married to an abusive witch for over 10 years. She was abused as a child and had an alcoholic dad. She was frigid and cut off sex. She was also emotionally abusive to him. He would bring me flowers, we'd go out like two people who were dating (i.e. go out of dinner, shopping, etc.), but he was clear that he only wanted a FWB and even started seeing someone else just before he made the decision to divorce his wife.</p><p>Upon divorcing her, he said he didn't want to be tied down with anyone and he left the state to pretty much start anew. It hurt me because yea, I got emotionally connected - especially when we did all those things together and he was a "catch"...very rare to find a 42 yr old handsome and fit like him (he did Jujitsu, mountain climbing, ex-military). But, like I'm telling you, he was able to compartmentalize and I think him not jumping into another "serious" RL w/o time after his divorce was a wise move....as much as it hurt me.</p><p>So yes, I believe men are better at compartmentalizing their RLs. Don't take it personal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7or%2FKppynZpOkunCtzayunqqjZK6tuI5qbW9wYWWCbr%2FEsamepJGptrC60qGgqWWnnsGpu9StZJ6ln6m2sLrSZqCsZZmperG70qygm6SVY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
