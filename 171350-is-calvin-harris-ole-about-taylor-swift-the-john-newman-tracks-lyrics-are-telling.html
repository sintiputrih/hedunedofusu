The John Newman Track's Lyrics Are Telling</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-03</div><p>It hasn't been very long since <a href=# class=T3D>Calvin Harris' new track with John Newman, "Olé,"</a> dropped, and I already have a million questions. What <a href=# class=T3D>do the lyrics mean</a>? Is "low key" a reference to Loki, Tom Hiddleston's character in <i>The Avengers</i>? Follow-up: If so, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>is Harris' "Olé" is about Taylor Swift</a> and his relationship with her? I told you: So many questions. But, they're all worth asking, and all worth answering — perhaps the third one most of all. So, is it?</p><p>The short answer is... well, it's not clear. The lyrics sure <i>sound</i> like they mirror the end of what the media has reported of Swift and Harris' relationship, especially <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>once Hiddleston came into the picture</a> at the 2016 Met Gala in May. I mean, just take a look at this line: "I see online that you begun to be a good girl and take trips with your boyfriend. Being attentive, continue to pretend." And what about this one? "Low key, you won't tell your friends about me." And <i>this</i> one?! "You've hidden my name in your phone so you can call me to tell me you've been going through hell/ Left him alone and you booked in a hotel." It's not difficult to see why some fans might be wondering if Harris and Newman have just released a song penned from the POV of Hiddleston in the Calvin Harris/Taylor Swift/Tom Hiddleston saga with lyrics like that.</p><p>But that doesn't mean they have. According to a source close to Swift <i>and</i> a source close to Harris speaking to <i>Us Weekly</i>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the song isn't about Swift and Hiddleston at all</a> — in fact, it might have even been penned before Swift and Harris ever broke up. "People are just making assumptions to get attention for a song... There’s no way it could be about Tom." Then: "It has nothing to do with Tom and Taylor."</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Rich Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Well, that does sound convincing and totally believable. But, considering it's not an official statement from Harris, Swift, or Hiddleston (or even Newman!), I'm inclined to call it just another theory for now.</p><p>Unfortunately, it looks like this one is going to remain a bit of a mystery until <i>one</i> of the involved parties comments. But hey... it's still pretty fun to go on hypothesizing, isn't it?</p><p>Olé <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>is available on iTunes</a>.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyg5BsbGllmah6pK3Lr6CnZZiWv7O10mampZ1dlq%2BwwdNmq5qxnKS%2Fbr%2FWop2tZaSdsm62zqGlZqaVrLqiuoytqZqbm6h6rcXRopqsZZGnsm7AxKWjoqaX</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
