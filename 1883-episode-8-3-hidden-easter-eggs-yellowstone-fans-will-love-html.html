Although 1883 takes place a century before Yellowstone, there are some references and easter eggs that Yellowstone fans will appreciate. Episode 8 especially called back to Yellowstone.</p><p id=par-2_7><strong>[Spoiler alert:&nbsp;1883&nbsp;Season 1 Episode 8 spoilers ahead.]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1883-Sam.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-elsa-helps-catch-a-wild-stallion-in-1883-epiosode-8>Elsa helps catch a wild stallion in ‘1883’ Epiosode 8</h2><p id=par-3_56><a href=#>Elsa Dutton</a> has been learning more and more cowboy skills as the journey continues. In 1883 Episode 8, a Comanche man named Sam teaches her how to catch a wild stallion by separating it from the herd. The pair manage to wrangle the whole herd of horses, which the immigrants will desperately need going forward.</p><p id=par-4_67>In Yellowstone, after Kayce returned from military service he attempted to <a href=#>make a living breaking horses</a> on the Broken Rock Reservation. Kayce catches a wild stallion by separating it from the herd, similar to Sam and Elsa’s techniques in 1883. Sam also gives the stallion to Elsa’s father as a gift for her hand in marriage, while Kayce gives the stallion to his own father, John.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James watches Sam break the stallion in the river</h2><p id=par-5_48>James isn’t thrilled with the gift of the wild stallion, knowing that it means Elsa may end up staying with the Comanches. Later in 1883 Episode 8, Sam shows James how the break the stallion in the river. This is clearly something James has never seen before.</p><p id=par-6_46>He watches Sam work with the horse in the water but is initially skeptical that the horse could be tamed so quickly. Sam tells James to run the horse if he wants it to give him his heart, and James is surprised by Sam’s success.</p><p id=par-7_54>Interestingly, this skill that James learned from the Comanches appears to be something he passed down for generations. In Yellowstone, John has a lot of trouble breaking the stallion gifted to him by Kayce. Rip suggests to John that they work with the horse chest-deep in the river in season 1 episode 2.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sam mentions Quanah Parker in ‘1883’ Episode 8</h2><p id=par-8_68>Yellowstone fans are familiar with the Four Sixes ranch. Although Yellowstone is set in Montana, the real Four Sixes ranch exists in Texas. Capt. Samuel “Burk” Burnett, founded the ranch in 1870. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thebullamarillo.com</a>, the Burnett family “leased in the Indian territory of Oklahoma around the turn of the 20th century. This gained them the respect of Comanche chief Quanah Parker, who became a family friend.”</p><p id=par-9_72>In 1883 Episode 8, Sam tells James, “My land is with Quanah Parker, south of the Wichita Mountains.” Sam also explains why he can’t leave his people after fighting so hard to defend their land. His words are full of foreshadowing for the future Duttons defending their ranch in Montana. “Maybe someday you find land to belong to and you’ll know what I mean,” Sam tells James.</p><p>New episodes of&nbsp;1883&nbsp;release Sundays on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2BeYSSZpypoaOksaZ5l2ZqZqCZmbGmuoyemKyslad6prPGrGSynZyhvLi%2F06ilnmWWlru0edaio6VlnKTDpnrHraSlZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
