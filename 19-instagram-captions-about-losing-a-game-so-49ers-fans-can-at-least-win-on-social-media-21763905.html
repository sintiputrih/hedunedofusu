I know, I’ll give you a moment of silence, some space to be in your feelings. When you’re ready to come back and come out on top, I have just the thing that will cure your broken Super Bowl heart: 19 losing Super Bowl Instagram captions that will soothe your weary soul. If nothing else you can get that itty, bitty dopamine hit from seeing your Instagram crush like your post.</p><p>The internet and world at large are full of quotes about winning. How it isn’t everything, it’s the only thing. How winners act and think and breathe and never quit. The word “winning” has been in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>catchphrases</a>, in <a href=# class=T3D>choruses</a>, in every sports drink commercial you can imagine. But where is the good loser content we crave? Because at the end of the day—specifically Super Bowl Sunday—we can’t all be winners.</p><p>It’s time to dry those tears, half-ironically cue up Beck’s “Loser,” and enjoy these captions that will ease the pain of losing the big game. After all, laughter and inspiring Instagram quotes are the best medicine. And for what they cannot cure, there is nacho cheese and beer.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Tom Pennington/Getty Images Sport/Getty Images</p></figure><h2><strong>1. “My diet was primarily cheese-based so I think we all know who </strong><strong>really</strong><strong> won the Super Bowl.”</strong></h2><p>Cheese is always a winner.</p><h2><strong>2. “I never lose.

Losing teaches you something. Having to try and going through the trials and tribulations to actually overcome, to get there, to win, to triumph, that's what makes life interesting.”</strong> ― <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Elizabeth Banks</a></h2><h2>7. “<strong>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.” </strong>― <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Bill Gates</a></h2><h2><strong>8. “Whether you win or lose, there is always Beyonc</strong>é<strong>.”</strong></h2><p>Also see: Blue Ivy.</p><h2><strong>9. “You've got to lose to know how to win.”</strong> ― <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Steven Tyler</a></h2><p>There are, like, 300 different varieties of this quote...but Steven Tyler only said this one.
