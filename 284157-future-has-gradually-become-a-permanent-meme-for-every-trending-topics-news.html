The reason that Future&nbsp;in particular&nbsp;was crowned the perfect subject for these kinds of occasions is because it is widely believed that the notorious womanizer is likely indulging in similar toxic behaviour, but you didn't hear that from us.</p><p>Roy Rochlin/2018 Getty Images</p><p>Though&nbsp;the holidays are behind us now, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-mce-href=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2020/02/future-memes-trending-topics/>fans are still finding new ways to use the meme to react to various trending topics</a>, and have even turned other&nbsp;media of Future into some hilarious memery.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Trending Topic: World War III</span></strong></p><p>Back in January when everyone was terrified that Donald Trump had lowkey triggered World War III by ordering the&nbsp;assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the Internet coped the only way it knows how:&nbsp;<a href=# rel data-mce-href=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/donald-trump-ordered-airstrike-that-killed-iranian-major-general-social-media-shares-wwiii-memes-news.99834.html>turned it into a meme.</a> Folks made good use of the&nbsp;toxic ex-boyfriend&nbsp;meme to portray someone using&nbsp;a current world event&nbsp;as an excuse&nbsp;to remind their ex of their past relationship.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1213239641781850113</a><br></p><p><strong><span data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Trending Topic:&nbsp;Lena Waithe's Marriage</span></strong></p><p>Back when writer/producer/actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel data-mce-href=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lena-waithe-and-wife-alana-mayo-split-after-two-months-of-marriage-report-news.101691.html>Lena Waithe announced her separation from wife&nbsp;Alana Mayo</a> after just two months of marriage, it was rumoured that <a href=# rel data-mce-href=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lena-waithe-allegedly-dating-actress-cynthia-erivo-days-after-split-from-wife-news.101903.html>Lena had cheated on Alana with&nbsp;Harriet&nbsp;star, Cynthia Erivo.</a> Future's infamous toxicity came in handy once again, as Twitter users compared Lena's adulterous ways to Future&nbsp;by editing a photo of the rapper looking at himself in the mirror.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/_/status/1220398315042484224</a><br></p><p><strong><span data-mce-style="text-decoration: underline;">Trending Topic:&nbsp;Hot Girl Summer</span></strong></p><p>Summer 2019 went down in history as Hot Girl Summer thanks to self-proclaimed Hot Girl, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>.
