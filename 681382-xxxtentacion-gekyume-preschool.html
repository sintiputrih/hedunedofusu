Although he was only mainstream for a few years prior to his passing, he was able to build a huge fanbase. Overall, he is seen as a transformative artist, especially in relation to the Soundcloud era. These days, fans are always remembering him in any way they can. His name has also been in the news due to the <a href=# rel>highly-publicized trial </a>involving his murderers. <a href=# rel>The men were all found guilty</a>, and for many, justice was finally served.</p><p>On a more positive note, XXXTentacion had a son with his former partner Jenesis Sanchez. Gekyume has been seen quite a bit on social media, and fans remain invested in his upbringing. While some may find this weird, others see him as a representation of X's time on this earth. Subsequently, Sanchez has always tried to give fans updates on her little one. However, as it turns out, Gekyume isn't so little these days. In the Instagram post below, you can see just how fast the kid is growing up.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion, Drake Are Most-Streamed Rappers</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-xxxtentacion-would-be-proud>XXXTentacion Would Be Proud</h2></span><p>Gekyume could be seen decked out in what appears to be a burgundy velour suit. Furthermore, there are balloons all around him and some blocks that spell out "GRAD." As it turns out, the young man has just graduated from pre-school. Ultimately, it is a small yet significant accomplishment for someone his age. Moreover, Jenesis took to the post's caption and simply wrote "Steppin in his lemon peps." In the comments section, fans were simply stunned by how fast the child has grown up as of late. It feels like just yesterday that he was actually born.</p><p>Overall, it is fair to say XXXTentacion would be proud of Gekyume. Moving forward, we're sure that Sanchez will continue offering these kinds of updates on her son. Until then, X's fans will continue to listen to his music as often as possible. To this day, he remains one of the highest-streaming artists of the last decade.
