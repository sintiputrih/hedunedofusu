In Wednesday, she’s played by none other than Catherine Zeta-Jones. It’s easy to recognize Catherine from her lengthy filmography which includes movies like The Legend of Zorro, Chicago, and High Fidelity. Morticia has a reputation for being beautiful in a spooky way, and Catherine pulls off the character effortlessly.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Luis Guzmán plays Gomez Addams</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luis Guzman (@loueyfromthehood)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Gomez Addams is played by none other than Luis Guzmán in Wednesday. Not only is Gomez supposed to be Wednesday’s father, but he’s also supposed to be the doting husband of Morticia. Wednesday spends the majority of her time in season one trying to unravel the creepy mystery that her father is connected to.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>He’s involved in some very deadly and haunting things –– and Wednesday is interested in peeling back all of the layers. It’s likely that TV lovers recognize Luis from roles on shows including Narcos and Shameless.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Fred Armisen plays Uncle Fester</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Fred Armisen (@sordociego)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Uncle Fester is played by none other than Fred Armisen in Wednesday. One thing that fans of the Addams family all recognize is the fact that Uncle Fester is one of the weirdest and most eccentric characters of all time. The perfect actor had to be selected to pull off such a kooky role, and Fred was certainly up for the challenge.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>Since Fred is such a comedic star, he never misses a beat while taking on the persona of Uncle Fester. Even though Wednesday is gun-shy when it comes to trusting the adults in her life, one thing she knows will always be certain is that Uncle Fester has her best interest at heart.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Since he has such in-depth knowledge when it comes to the knowledge of dark arts, she knows that she can rely on him to tell her some of the most nitty-gritty secrets ever. Portlandia and Saturday Night Live are some of the places fans recognize Fred from prior to landing his role as Uncle Fester. You might’ve also caught him in episodes of New Girl and Brooklyn Nine-Nine in the past as well.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Isaac Ordonez plays Pugsley Addams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/isaac.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Wednesday’s younger brother is named Pugsley Addams. In Wednesday, Pugsley is played by a young actor named Isaac Ordonez. Even though Wednesday is more comfortable hiding behind a cold-hearted and tough exterior, the one person she has a soft spot for happens to be Pugsley.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>Since he’s her little brother, she has a natural instinct to protect him from bad things and shield him from any damage that might come his way. Wednesday doesn’t soften up for friends, crushes, teachers, or other family members. Pugsley is the one person she’s willing to go to bat for. Isaac hasn’t appeared in any other major roles so far, making Wednesday his true debut.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Christina Ricci plays Marilyn Thornhill</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Christina Ricci (@riccigrams)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=608 data-injectable=true>There is no denying the fact that Christina Ricci took on the role of Wednesday Addams in an incredibly delightful way back in the early 90s. She handled the role of Wednesday in The Addams Family and Addams Family Values, back to back. In both movies, she was brilliantly charming without missing any cues.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>This time around, she is playing Marilyn Thornhill in Wednesday. Marilyn happens to be the only totally normal teacher at Wednesday’s school. Even though all the other teachers she works with are beyond strange, she doesn’t care to go out of her way to stand out.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Instead, she lives her life in a way that makes her feel the most comfortable by trying to connect with her students. One of her greatest goals is to gain Wednesday’s trust, which isn’t something that happens overnight. Along with playing memorably playing Wednesday, Christina has also starred in Yellowjackets and The Matrix Resurrections.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gwendoline Christie plays Principal Larissa Weems</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gwendoline Christie (@gwendolineuniverse)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=805 data-injectable=true>One of the first places viewers recognize Gwendoline Christie happens to be Game of Thrones on HBO where she had one of the most epic roles ever, playing the role of Brienne of Tarth. Brienne was tall, mighty, and strong, and her goal in life was to protect the lives of the Stark girls no matter what or who got in her way. Now, she is the principal at Wednesday’s school. Interestingly enough, Principal Larissa is supposed to be a childhood rival of Morticia, adding to the intricate layers of drama.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Riki Lindhome plays <strong>Dr. Valerie Kinbott</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Riki Lindhome (@rikilindhome)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=false>Wednesday has a therapist in the show named Dr. Valerie Kinbott.
