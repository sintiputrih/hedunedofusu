Cole is a respected R&B artist, and Brown is a free agent NFL player who started dabbling in music in 2019.

Cole told TMZ, “I think he’s really talented, for sure. I love the body of work that he created. I think he’s gonna be great. I do. I wouldn’t have collaborated if I didn’t think he’d be great.” Her comments led many to wonder if the pair might be more than just music collaborators.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Our inclinations were met with evidence when photos of Brown began appearing on Cole’s Instagram Stories with the caption “missing him a lot.” What really nailed the rumor home was when Brown, whose stage name and Instagram handle is “AB”, posted a video on Instagram of Cole dancing. In the since-deleted video, a close up of Cole’s backside was seen as well as glimpses of her tattoo, Brown’s stage name “AB,” on her back as her hair swishes side to side.&nbsp;And the caption to the video? “You Ain’t Pimpin Until You Hit An RnB Diva.”</p><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>However, it was trouble in paradise for the potential pair when Cole took to social media to apologize to Brown saying, “Don’t be mad at me no more babe, I said I apologize.” What she’s apologizing for is not known. Better yet, in Instagram Live session with EJ King, a celebrity stylist, Cole talked about how Brown’s comments were more than a little harsh and how she was “trying to figure out” her relationship with him. However, Cole said Brown “made it very clear. He was like, ‘Baby, I liked you at first, but now I don’t — it’s a no.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Cole’s apology didn’t last long. She then posted and now-deleted an Instagram story that The Shade Room managed to capture before she took it down. In it, she says, “Yeah I was big trippin…smh I see it now. I have a 12-year-old. Like that type disrespect for what…Nothing is worth that level of disrespect, especially when u don’t deserve it. Had so much love, respect, and admiration fa you. Guess that wasn’t mutual either.”</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>Things got even more heated when Brown shared a few choice words in response to Cole’s comment in another since-deleted Instagram story captured by daily news Hip Hop Twitter account @mymixtapez. In the story Brown said, “Keyshia Cole, I’m a playa, we don’t want you Keyshia, stay off my d**k, you heard.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Antonio Brown tells Keyshia Cole he’s a player after she gets his name tattooed 👀 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mnDYBPgPVK</a></p>— My Mixtapez (@mymixtapez) <a href=#>May 17, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>What started out as a respectful musical collaboration seems to have taken a sharp turn in the opposite direction.
