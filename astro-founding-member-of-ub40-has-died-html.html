We weren’t planning the revolution, but if the revolution happened, we knew what side we were going to be on.” In the same interview, Astro said he was radicalized in part by the “sus law,” which allowed police to arrest people on the grounds of of acting suspiciously. Shock of all shocks, this law was enforced in a racially biased manner. “It was a weekly occurrence,” he said. “We found it harder to write love songs than militant lyrics, because it was a lot easier to write about stuff you had witnessed or read about. It seemed natural to us.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvq4lhs5001a3g6icwesncry@published data-word-count=123>Reggae was itself a political choice by the band, as it aligned them with the Windrush generation, African-Caribbean immigrants that came to England after World War II and faced scorn from many. Songs like the anti-Thatcher “Madame Medusa” snuck politics into a dance beat. The band won an early fan in the Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde, who had UB40 open for them. The band’s biggest Stateside hits were covers. Slate’s <a href=#>Hit Parade</a> podcast’s inaugural episode was about how the Neil Diamond song became a hit for the Brummie band. UB40 split into two bands in 2013, both of which laid claim to being the one true UB40. The other UB40 also announced Wilson’s passing via <a href=#>social media</a>, writing “Our sincere condolences to his family.”</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Guardian</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjms2f3ia000kc4yedoe6aj1m@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>A Primer on UB40, the Band Brett Kavanaugh for Some Reason Wanted to Fight</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Astro, Founding Member of UB40, Has Died</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdhZnyiv9Orpmaen6q7pbXNoGSmnZ2XsrN5zp9krppkZXqprdJmm6KdlGO1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
