Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, December 13, 2022, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>The food-savvy are bound to know that Japanese snacks have become increasingly popular over the last few years, which is why we thought the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bokksu monthly snack box</a> would be such an on-point gift! This subscription is fantastic and covetable for a few key reasons. For starters, the snacks themselves are truly unique. Each box features approximately 20 to 25 different treats to try, so you’re basically tasting a new item practically every day for the entire month!&nbsp;</span></p><p>And as a number of reviewers highlight, these snacks aren’t the same snacks you can pick up at your local Asian supermarket. They’re <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">handpicked and sourced</a> from family-run businesses in Japan and are curated each month to follow different themes relating to Japanese culture. It even comes with a booklet so you can learn about where each treat is from. We’re obsessed — this is the ultimate gift for someone who likes to step out of their culinary comfort zone!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bokksu – Authentic Japanese Snack & Candy Subscription</a> starting at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$45</a> at Amazon!
