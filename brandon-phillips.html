The Reds also sent $13 million in the deal, leaving the Braves to pay $1 million of Phillips' remaining salary. He made a late-season position switch to third base to facilitate the promotion of <a href=#>Ozzie Albies</a> to the major leagues. On August 30, Phillips hit a bloop single to drive in <a href=#>Ender Inciarte</a> for his 2,000th career hit. In 120 games for the Braves, Phillips batted .291 with 11 home runs and 52 RBIs.</p><p>On August 31, 2017, Phillips was traded to the Los Angeles Angels for cash considerations and <a href=#>Tony Sanchez</a>. In 24 games played with the Angels, Phillips had a slash line of .255/.269/.382 in 102 at bats.</p><p>In 2016, Phillips appeared in 141 games, batting .291 with 11 home runs and 64 RBIs. He also stole 14 bases while being caught eight times.</p><p>On October 29, 2015, he was named a finalist for the Gold Glove for second base.</p><p>Phillips was placed on the disabled list July 11, 2014, after suffering a torn thumb ligament while diving for a ground ball in a game against the Chicago Cubs. At the time, he was hitting .272 with 7 home runs and 40 RBI, and had only committed one error in 86 games at second base. He was reinstated from the DL on August 18. Phillips finished the season hitting .266 with 8 home runs and 56 RBI.</p><p>On October 23, 2014, he was nominated for his potential 5th Gold Glove for second base.</p><p>On August 28, Phillips was moved to the second spot in the lineup, and <a href=#>Jay Bruce</a> became the cleanup hitter.

Phillips was represented in contract negotiations by ACES Inc. When the All-Star game roster was announced on July 1, Phillips was not amongst those voted in by either fans or National League players and coaches. Reds manager Dusty Baker took exception at retired St. Louis Cardinals manager but the National League's All-Star Game manager Tony La Russa, claiming Phillips and fellow Reds teammate <a href=#>Johnny Cueto</a> were left off the roster because they were at the heart of an on-field fight involving Baker's Reds and La Russa's Cardinals in 2010. Baker stated "it just kind of looks bad that Johnny and Brandon were at the center of the skirmish between us and the Cardinals. Some of the Cardinals that aren't there any more are making some of the selections." Phillips, who was hitting just under .290 with 10 HR and 46 RBI at the time the selections were announced, declined to comment on the matter. USA Today's Mike Jones mentioned the large number of votes for San Francisco Giants players, including <a href=#>Pablo Sandoval</a> (.300, 6 HR, 25 RBI) who was named the All-Star game's third baseman over New York Mets' David Wright (over .350, 9 HR, 50 RBI) was responsible for "taking away an infield spot."</p><p>In 2012, Brandon Phillips had a .281 batting average, 18 home runs, and 77 runs batted in.

His fielding percentage for the season was .992 in 721 chances. The next day, it was announced that Phillips had won the first Silver Slugger of his Major League career. He hit an even .300 with 183 hits, 38 doubles, 2 triples, 18 homers, and 82 RBI. His on-base percentage was .353.</p><p>In 2010, Phillips had his first All-Star season. He finished the season batting .275, with 18 homers, 59 RBI, and 16 stolen bases.</p><p>In early August, Phillips made national sports headlines with unflattering remarks about the St. Louis Cardinals, a team the Reds were in a hotly contested race with for lead in the National League Central division. Phillips was quoted by the Dayton Daily News as saying "I hate the Cardinals. All they do is bitch and moan about everything, all of them, they're little bitches, all of them. ... I hate the Cardinals." The next night, August 10, Phillips was involved in a large bench-clearing brawl between the Reds and Cardinals at home plate. Coming to bat in the bottom of the 1st inning, Phillips customarily tapped his bat against the shin pads of Cardinals catcher <a href=#>Yadier Molina</a> and the umpire. Molina kicked Phillips' bat, which led to seven minutes of pushing and shoving between both teams before both team managers were ejected and order was restored.</p><p>On November 10, 2010, it was announced that Phillips had won the second Gold Glove of his Major League career.</p><p>The 86th All-Star Game was played at Great American Ball Park, and Cardinals catcher <a href=#>Yadier Molina</a> was selected to play. In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, he was assigned Phillips' locker. Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. When informed of whose locker he was using, he replied, "This is Phillips' locker? How about that? I'll have to write something to him." However, during pregame roster introductions, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players in jest who were selected, including Molina, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols, who was then with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Phillips finished the season hitting .294 (16th in the National League) with 173 hits (8th in the NL), 12 home runs, 70 RBI, and 23 stolen bases (10th in the NL).</p><p>In 2009, Phillips hit .276/.329/.447, with 30 doubles, 20 home runs, 98 RBI and 25 stolen bases.</p><p>Phillips received a four-year, $27&nbsp;million contract extension on February 15, 2008, instead of going to arbitration.</p><p>On April 2, 2008, Phillips hit his first home run of the season against the Arizona Diamondbacks. At the All-Star Break, Phillips was batting .287 with 15 home runs, 58 RBI, 18 stolen bases, and 18 doubles.

He also won a Fielding Bible Award as the top fielding second baseman in MLB.</p><p>In 2007, Phillips hit 30 home runs and stole 32 bases to become the first Reds second baseman to join the 30–30 club and just the third 30–30 Red, joining <a href=#>Eric Davis</a> (37 HR, 50 SB in 1987) and <a href=#>Barry Larkin</a> (33 HR, 36 SB in 1996). He also joined <a href=#>Alfonso Soriano</a> as just the second baseman in the 30–30 club.</p><p>In the fourth inning on August 1, 2007, game, against <a href=#>John Lannan</a> of the Washington Nationals Phillips stole two bases on one pitch while the Nationals had a shift on <a href=#>Adam Dunn</a>. On August 30, Phillips made the play of the month to win the game for the Reds against the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the Reds winning 5–4 in the bottom of the 9th, <a href=#>Nate McLouth</a> of the Pirates hit a single into right field. The runner from second, <a href=#>Josh Phelps</a>, appeared likely to score but Phillips grabbed the ball in shallow right field bare-handed and threw Phelps out at home plate to win the game. On September 5, he hit his 28th home run of the season, breaking the Reds' single-season record for home runs by a second baseman, formerly held by <a href=#>Joe Morgan</a>. On September 26, 2007, Phillips hit his 30th home run of the season.</p><p>In addition to the home runs and steals, Phillips ended the 2007 season with 187 hits, 107 runs, 26 doubles, 6 triples, 94 RBIs, and a .288 batting average. He led the Reds in runs, hits, triples, and stolen bases and was second on the team in doubles and home runs.</p><p>On April 7, 2006, Cleveland's frustration with Phillips' slow progress peaked and he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for a player to be named later (pitcher Jeff Stevens). He made an immediate impact, starting the season by being named NL Player of the Week the same month he was acquired by the Reds, hitting .452 (14–31) with 3 home runs and 17 runs batted in for the week of April 17–23. Phillips' 17 RBI were the most for an NL Player of the Week since Sammy Sosa had 19 RBI the week of August 4–10, 2002.

He appeared in six games for the Indians in July but was sent back down following the stint.</p><p>In 2004, he started the season in Buffalo. He hit .303 with 14 stolen bases on the season and recorded 18-game and 16-game hitting streaks. In the minor league play-offs, Phillips hit .308. He joined the Indians at the end of the season and played six games for them.</p><p>Phillips attended Redan High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia, where he played basketball and baseball. His #7 at Redan was retired by the school in December 2003. He was the star baseball player at his high school. Phillips' favorite baseball player growing up was Cincinnati Reds shortstop <a href=#>Barry Larkin</a>.</p><p>In 2003, Phillips won the starting job at second base for the Indians.

After that he went 0-for-29 and was sent down to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons after the All-Star break. He was recalled soon after that due to an injury to one of his teammates and finished the season with a .208 average, six homers, 33 RBIs and four stolen bases. Phillips also totaled a .981 fielding percentage.</p><p>After several years in the Expos farm system, Phillips was part of a six-player trade that sent him from the Montreal Expos to the Cleveland Indians on June 27, 2002.
