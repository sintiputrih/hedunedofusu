HRH Cardi B — the best of the Bronx, poet laureate of female lubrication and world-class spitfire — split from husband and apex Sagittarius Offset. The news broke in early December amid accusations that he was unfaithful to her (again) with Pisces up-and-comer Chrisean Rock.
Never one for stoicism, Cardi took to Instagramto air her grievances and her high hopes for a brighter, better year ahead, declaring: “We keep saying every year, ‘New year, new me, new this, new that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sagittarius is interested in external exploration and personal expansion, while Scorpio is interested in internal investigation/perpetual accusation.</p><p>He’s looking to connect in a light-hearted, rock ‘n’ roll, take it-on-the-run, effusive jokes way — and she’s looking to have unbroken eye contact and talk about sex, shame, death, black holes and anything and everything that’s graying toward shadow territory.</p><p>You can think of their pillow talk as <a href=#>Wednesday Addams</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd from “Wedding Crashers”</a> (Cardi) trying to feel understood by/cerebrally connected to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse from “Toy Story.”</a> Lots of blank stares, cold shoulders and shaking heads.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>You can think of their pillow talk as Todd from “Wedding Crashers” trying to feel understood by Jesse from “Toy Story”</p></figure><p>Mercury in Scorpio is also highly suspicious, and with Offset’s alleged indiscretions peppering their relationship from the get-go, you can bet Cardi had plenty to drive her to the dark side.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Venus love trap</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Evidence of the Venus in Scorpio connection between Cardi and Offset. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Both of these crazy kids have Venus, planet of love and attraction, in the basement heart, never-let-go sign of Scorpio. This is the black leather tie that binds and the aspect that explains their on-again, off(set) relationship dynamic.</p><p>Scorpio is the sign of sex and secrets and does nothing lightly — least of all love. Wanting pleasure but feeling more comfortable with pain, this Venus on Venus combination has no chill. It is magnetic, it is hard to quit and it will always, always be a power struggle.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2.5><p>This shared, obsessive, onl- happy-when it-hurts Venus connection suggests these two may not be done torturing one another yet.</p></figure><p>The ancient ruler of Scorpio is Mars, the planet of war. In kind, or not so kind, Venus in Scorpio folk view love as a life or death, kill-or-be-killed scenario. Think always on guard with a deep need for intimacy that is matched in intensity only by a crippling fear of betrayal. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Telltale Cardi lyric</a>: “It’s gon’ hurt me to hate you, but lovin’ you’s worse.”</p><p>With that aspect, both Offset and Cardi are seeking, consciously or subconsciously, transformation through their love relationships, pulling them toward partners that challenge and change but might not meet their essential needs. This shared, obsessive, only-happy-when-it-hurts Venus connection suggests these two may not be done torturing one another just yet.</p><p>Dare to dream.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mars mismatch</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cardi B and Offset’s Mars signs are at odds. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Cardi has Mars, planet of action and aggression, in Cancer, signifying that she puts a lot of energy into family, root systems and security. Mars is weakened in Cancer as the planet of war is unwelcome in the sign of the home front.</p><p>As such, Mars in Cancer folk often struggle with expressing their Martian energy in direct or healthy ways; for further evidence, see the life and times of fellow Mars in Cancer celebrity powder kegs like <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>, <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> and <a href=#>Tommy Lee</a>,</p><p>Offset has his Mars in the cowboy-esque, fun-having sign of Sagittarius, suggesting that he puts a lot of energy into having a good time, exploring the fringes, making light and testing his limits. Mars in Cancer takes things hard and to heart, while Mars in Sag lets conflict roll off the back with a smile, a wink, a poorly timed joke and an optimistic, unrealistic promise to be better.</p><p>As you can imagine, these two energies are oft at odds; the water of Cardi’s Mars can put a damper on the easy, breezy, sleazy fire of Offset while his inconsistence, nonchalance and general disregard for hearth, heart and home can boil her proverbial teapot.</p><p>No dice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fated for each other?</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cardi B’s North Node is conjunct with Offset’s sun in Sagittarius. <span class=credit>Getty Images for The Recording A</span></figure><p>Cardi’s North Node, or point of destiny and actualization, is in Sagittarius, Offet’s sun sign — indicating to me that these two were meant to be but not made to last. Offset, as both a partner and a co-parent, was and is an essential part of Cardi’s evolution. Yet, in the book of love, he’s the plot twist but not the prince in shining armor, dig?</p><p>Because we champion love in all its myriad messiness, my hope is that apart or together, at war or in love (same-same but different for Venus in Scorpio), these two find what they’re looking for and find that the best is yet to come.</p><p>Astrologer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reda Wigle</a>&nbsp;researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.
