Because I think if people were to argue: Then what about alcohol and cigarettes? Well, everything is good but in moderation.</p><p>In the final question and answer portion, the top three contestants were asked the same question by Harvey: "What is the most important lesson you’ve learned in your life and how will you apply it to your time as Miss Universe?" She answered:</p><p>I work a lot in the slums of Tondo, Manila and the life there is very... it's poor and it's very sad. And I’ve always taught myself to look for the beauty in it; to look in the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful. And I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe to see situations with a silver lining, and to assess where I could give something, where I could provide something as a spokesperson. And this I think if I could also teach people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster, and children will have a smile on their faces.</p><p>On 17 October 2019, Gray attended the 2019 Latin Music Awards at the Dolby Theatre, Hollywood and Highlands in Los Angeles, California where she presented the 2019 "Canción Favorita – Tropical" award for the song "Adicto" to Marc Anthony and <a href=#>Prince Royce</a>.</p><p>On 8 December 2019, Gray crowned <a href=#>Zozibini Tunzi</a> of South Africa as her successor at the 2019 Miss Universe competition at Tyler Perry Studios, in Atlanta, Georgia, the United States.</p><p>On 8 January 2018, Gray submitted her application to Binibining Pilipinas to officially join the 2018 national pageant. Eight days later, Binibing Pilipinas national director Stella Araneta confirmed that Gray will be officially competing at the Binibining Pilipinas 2018 pageant.</p><p>During the national costume competition, Gray wore a Muslim princess attire from the Mindanao region and bagged the national costume award. On 18 March 2018, she was crowned as Miss Universe Philippines 2018 by the outgoing titleholder <a href=#>Rachel Peters</a>.</p><p>Gray represented the Philippines in the 2018 Miss Universe contest on 17 December 2018 held at IMPACT Arena, Muang Thong Thani in Nonthaburi Province, Thailand. During the national costume show presentation, Gray showcased a beaded tribal suit featuring the indigenous tribes of the ancient pagan Filipinos, alongside an oversized Parol painted Christmas lantern pulled by a roller device. The costume was accompanied by a pre-Christian Shamanic dance of the historical Babaylan paganism. The costume gained both support and criticism, due to the perceived difficulty of walking and the failure of LEDs to function, whilst Gray cited her scoliosis ailment.</p><p>On 2 October 2016, Gray was crowned Miss World Philippines 2016 where she won the following special awards:</p><p>During the final question and answer round all the five finalist were asked the same question, "Why should you be Miss World Philippines 2016?", Gray answered:</p><p>After winning the national competition, Gray competed at Miss World 2016 held in MGM National Harbor, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, United States where she was placed in the Top 5.

She is the fourth Filipina Miss Universe after <a href=#>Gloria Diaz</a> in 1969, Margarita Moran in 1973, and <a href=#>Pia Wurtzbach</a> in 2015.</p><p>Gray was born in Cairns, Queensland, to a Scottish-born father, Ian Gray, from Fraserburgh, and a Filipina mother, Normita Ragas Magnayon, from Oas, Albay.
