The modern construction of the object, its eight-inch square tiles, and its close proximity to the Florida Space Coast led the team to contact NASA representatives, who recently confirmed that the find is indeed a remnant of the Challenger.</p><p>The History Channel also shared a video of the recovery of the Challenger wreckage:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>What they uncover off the coast of Florida, outside of the Triangle, marks the first discovery of wreckage from the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger in more than 25 years.

NASA, however, <a href=# rel=noopener>went through with the Challenger launch</a> anyway.</p><p>Moreover, many of the crew likely survived the explosion itself, instead remaining conscious as they hurtled back towards the Earth at a speed of 207 miles per hour before hitting the surface of the ocean — likely being torn from their seats and smashed against the cabin walls.</p><p>The catastrophic failure was caused by a problem with the shuttle’s O-rings — rubber seals that lined parts of the Challenger‘s rocket boosters. What’s worse is that NASA had been aware of problems with O-rings for 15 years before the Challenger explosion.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-408684 alt="Challenger Shuttle Explosion" width=600 height=768 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/challenger-shuttle-explosion.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-408684 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A photograph of the Challenger space shuttle, just over a minute after it launched as it exploded.</span></p><p>In fact, a defense contractor warned in 1971 that it was possible to burn through a shuttle’s O-rings —&nbsp;and that if it occurred near a hydrogen fuel tank, it could be disastrous.</p><p>Over a decade later, NASA continued to face problems with their shuttles’ O-rings, with seven of the nine shuttle launches in the years before the Challenger incident showing signs of damaged O-rings.</p><p>At the time, Commissioner Richard Feynman had even warned that the agency was playing “a kind of Russian Roulette… You got away with it, but it shouldn’t be done over and over again.”</p><p>Yet, despite all of the warnings and evidence that things could go wrong, the Challenger‘s launch was pushed through, and to deadly results.</p><p>The incident marked significant changes in NASA’s shuttle programs, most notably the addition of an emergency escape system for the crew on board.</p><p>“At NASA, the core value of safety is – and must forever remain – our top priority,” Nelson said in the new statement, “especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”</p><p>NASA says they are now considering what to do with the newly recovered wreckage, hoping to find a purpose for it that will honor the crew of the Challenger.</p><p>Next, check out <a href=#>25 vintage NASA photos</a> that harken back to space exploration’s most important moments.
