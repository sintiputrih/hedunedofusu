After Betty White passed away 17 days before her 100th birthday, it got us thinking about all the actors who weren’t so lucky to even see 99.

Many pre-teen actors landed their breakthrough role in a golden decade for Hollywood, wherein corporations released some of the best entertainment content to this date. You’ll no doubt remember their faces from prominent parts, but perhaps you’ll not be so educated on their stories… and everybody has one.</p><h3 id=h-heather-o-rourke data-injectable=false>Heather O’Rourke</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Poltergeist-Heather-ORourke.jpg><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>Hands down the most famous child actor on this list, Heather O’Rourke will be remembered for her chilling delivery of “They’re heeeeere” in 1982’s Poltergeist. O’Rourke portrays Carol Ann, a five-year-old belonging to the Freeling family who can commune with supernatural entities through the television set. Initially, the spirits seem friendly and playful, but they soon turn unexpectedly menacing and violent. She would reprise the role in both Poltergeist II: The Other Side&nbsp;(1986) and&nbsp;Poltergeist III&nbsp;(1988), the latter of which was released posthumously.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>O’Rourke died in 1988 following two cardiac arrests that were later ruled as congenital&nbsp;stenosis&nbsp;of the intestine complicated by&nbsp;septic shock. She was just 12. Poltergeist later became known as a ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cursed</a>‘ series after four cast members&nbsp;died&nbsp;during and soon after the filming.</p><h3 id=h-gary-coleman data-injectable=false>Gary Coleman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gary-Coleman.jpg><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>Although he didn’t die as young as some of the other stars, Gary Coleman still passed away much before his time.
