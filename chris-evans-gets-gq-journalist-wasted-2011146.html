For his July GQ cover story, the 30-year-old Captain America: The First Avenger star took his interviewer, journalist Edith Zimmerman, to a wild party at West Hollywood hotspot Voyeur.
&#34;My poor publicist,&#34; Evans said. &#34;She knows I like to drink. She was like, 'Please don't drink too much, please just don't drink too much — you're gonna take this person out, and they're going to ruin you."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Wearing a white T-shirt and a black cap, the actor plucked the writer out of the crowed, gave her a big kiss on the cheek and brought her back to the VIP section.</p><p>As Zimmerman mingled with Evans' closest friends, "there were intermittent visits from Chris for enthusiastic hand holding and cheek kissing," Zimmerman writes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Five days after their wild night together, the two reconnected in New York City and recapped the wild night. Evans even told his mom: "Edith was hammered! Hammered!"</p><p>After the club, Zimmerman blacked out and apparently attempted to "crawl out a window and wander off" from Evans' home. Evans noticed her "in the gutter" and took her back inside. The next morning, the dazed writer, failing to hail or call a cab, eventually hitched a ride back to her hotel with "a very pretty, blonde, possibly Asian transsexual and her much younger male friend," she writes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmoeqbCwKeqZp%2BVqcBus9BmoaitoqOurbXSrWSwmaOpsqV5kWloamlka3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
