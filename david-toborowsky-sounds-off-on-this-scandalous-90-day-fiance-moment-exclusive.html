The former college football player claimed the whole thing <a href=#>was totally fake</a>, allegedly said at the behest of producers. Regardless of what actually happened, David Toborowsky wasn't sweating it.</p><p dir=ltr>"I don't really dwell on the negatives of the past," he says. "I feel like maybe he was saying it half jokingly. I don't think he was serious in asking for massage, so I just brush that off. Chris has a good heart. He's a good person." David doesn't fault his friend for the tough times either, even after he was forced to move into a glorified storage unit. "It was tough times at the beginning. Again, that was my fault, not Chris'," he says. "... That was my decisions that led to tough times."</p><p dir=ltr>Today,&nbsp;<a href=#>Annie and David don't need roommates</a>. They have a blossoming business offering virtual cooking classes and catering, as well as a line of Thai cooking oils. They've got a Hollywood agent (Dominion Talent House) and a gig on <a href=#>the spin-off</a> "90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk." They've even managed to smooth over their once-strained relationship with Chris. "We're friends," David says. "We live far apart, so it's not like we hang out ... everybody's busy in such different directions, but I still wish them the best of everything."</p><p dir=ltr>You can take a cooking lesson with David and Annie or try the couple's cooking oils via their website <a href=#>Cooking with D-N-A</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29iboR3e8OaraKcXam8o7vRqK6so6liwLDBzZ2qZqeWm3qwuoytn6KrXaiworrDmqOoraNihnF5w5qwZp6ZlruksYympqadnql6psTCpaysoaaafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
