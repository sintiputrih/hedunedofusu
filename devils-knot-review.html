The question&nbsp;of whether Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, Jr. were actually guilty of the savage crimes seems to destined never to be definitively answered, though most films about the case have emphasized how tenuous links between the trio and the murders actually were.</p><p data-characters=778 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true><a href=#><strong><i>Devil’s Knot</i></strong></a>, Atom Egoyan’s dramatization of the investigation and subsequent trials, features bankable Hollywood stars like Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon, and that star power makes this&nbsp;retelling more likely to appeal to the masses than the documentary coverage. That’s why it’s so unfortunate that Egoyan never manages to do&nbsp;right by his powerful source material. Struggling to make&nbsp;Devil’s Knot&nbsp;a tense legal drama, an&nbsp;emotional exploration&nbsp;of&nbsp;grief and an accurate presentation&nbsp;of the notorious case all at once, Egoyan winds&nbsp;up doing none of those things. Though the director’s intentions were certainly noble,&nbsp;Devil’s Knot arrives as little more than a bland, muddled retread of a story most of us have heard before.</p><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>It’s clear that Egoyan, who has ventured into the heart of grief before with <i>Exotica</i> and&nbsp;The Sweet Hereafter, wanted to capture the essential tragedy&nbsp;of this case – of Pamela&nbsp;Hobbs (Witherspoon), whose son Stevie was among the victims; of Damien (James Hamrick), Jason (Seth Meriwether) and Jessie (Kris Higgins), the&nbsp;targets of a witch hunt by both police and terrified locals; and not least of all of West Memphis itself, a&nbsp;community turned on its head and&nbsp;blinded by xenophobia&nbsp;and helplessness. Perhaps&nbsp;Devil’s Knot would have been a better film if Egoyan had kept the focus there, on Pamela and the other Memphis residents.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Instead, Egoyan&nbsp;focuses on Ron Lax (Firth), a private investigator with his own theories about the murders. Lax, a bit player in the 1993 trials, is the wrong character&nbsp;to follow, which quickly becomes clear as&nbsp;his generic background is introduced (the guy has a divorce pending and habits a bar – that’s about all the insight we get). Though this clearly was not Egoyan’s intention, putting Lax front and center distances the audience from both the brutality&nbsp;of the murders themselves and the horror of the trials that followed.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/devils-knot2-539x360.jpg alt="devils knot" width=539 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=662 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Paradise Lost, in three separate feature-length documentaries, extensively covered the West Memphis Three case, pursuing many leads in an attempt to give watchers a sense of just how tangled the case became. There’s no such complexity in Egoyan’s film, and at times it even feels insultingly dumbed down. The ignorance of the police, the crushing mob mentality of West Memphis’s petrified residents, the key pieces of evidence missed in the investigation – none of those aspects of this case trul come through. It’s crucial for films exploring a case as multi-faceted as this to be thorough, and&nbsp;Devil’s Knot is anything but.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Egoyan’s writers, Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, this summer’s&nbsp;Deliver Us from Evil), dwell more on haunting imagery than hard facts, not that surprising given their horror-heavy resumes. At one point, Lax even has a dream in which Stevie’s untied shoelaces turn into cords binding him as he pedals through the woods. Visually, it’s interesting, but is it necessary? At what point does exploring this case turn into exploiting it?</p><p data-characters=735 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>Witherspoon turns in a powerful&nbsp;portrayal of a mother lost entirely in her grief, while Firth ably hits the few notes required of his one-note character, but none of the performances add much to wider understanding of this case. Bruce Greenwood glowers as the biased judge, the three actors playing Damien, Jason and Jessie are believable, and the supporting players are strongly acted by the likes of Mireille Enos, Dane DeHaan, Stephen Moyer, Alessandro Nivola and Amy Ryan. Still, for all their dramatic line readings, I&nbsp;never felt like I was watching anything less than Hollywood stars playing thin caricatures of people &nbsp;those familiar with this case have already met.&nbsp;As a film,&nbsp;Devil’s Knot almost folds in on itself.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>The writers toss us scraps of evidence – the mysterious&nbsp;Bojangles man, a bloodstained knife owned&nbsp;by suspicious John Mark Byers (Kevin Durand) – but never weave them smoothly into the main&nbsp;narrative. As a result,&nbsp;Devil’s Knot is far more confusing than it needed to be. Contained in the fact that&nbsp;Devil’s Knot lost me along the way is another question: what’s the point of a Hollywood take&nbsp;that can’t effectively communicate the hard facts of its own story?</p><p data-characters=759 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>If you really want to learn about the travesties of justice perpetrated&nbsp;against the West Memphis Three, just watch&nbsp;Paradise Lost and its two follow-ups. All three films do a fine job of clearly detailing the case and presenting alternate theories about what really happened.&nbsp;With all that documentary footage floating around, Egoyan never finds anything to add, and&nbsp;Devil’s Knot&nbsp;focuses&nbsp;only on territory that has been better explored elsewhere. Though Egoyan’s aims&nbsp;– to drive home the awful miscarriage of justice and pervasive grief present in&nbsp;the West Memphis Three case – are commendable,<strong>&nbsp;Devil’s Knot&nbsp;</strong>is inescapably&nbsp;lazy, disorganized and melodramatic. Don’t judge this empty&nbsp;book by its photogenic cover.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Disappointing</h5><p class=review-summary>Misguided, melodramatic and ultimately pointless, Devil's Knot pales in comparison to the fine documentaries that have already scrutinized the West Memphis Three case.</p><p class=review-title>Devil's Knot</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom56umaHAbrfNqKtmqpWrtqbDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
