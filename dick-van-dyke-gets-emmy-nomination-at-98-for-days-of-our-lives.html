He was recognized for this guest star role on Days of Our Lives.</p><p>The actor made his soap opera debut in September 2023 as Timothy Robicheaux. He joined the cast for a special four-part arc with his real-life friend and <a href=#>gym buddy</a>, <strong>Drake Hogestyn</strong>, who has been on Days off and on since 1986.</p><p>“I said, ‘Don’t you have any parts for old people? Come on give me one.’ And he took me seriously and got me a part!” Van Dyke told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a> in April 2023 about coaxing his pal to get him a role on the soap.</p><p>While preparing for the role, Van Dyke shared that he watched a bunch of Days episodes to get a feel for what the actors on the series have been doing over the years.</p><p>“Some of the people have been doing it for 20 years,” he recalled. “That’s all the homework I can do, watch one and see how they do it. The other thing, you have to hold, ‘duh duh,’ there’s this thing of music, and we’ve said something exciting.”</p><p>During Van Dyke’s stint on the show, it was revealed that his character was the long-lost father of Hogestyn’s character, John Black.</p><p>While Van Dyke is the oldest person to receive a Daytime Emmy nod, this isn’t his first time being up for the award. Van Dyke won in 1984 for Outstanding Performer in Children’s Programming for CBS Library: The Wrong Way Kid and in 2015 for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program thanks to his role in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey’s Pirate Adventure.</p><p>Van Dyke has also earned five Primetime Emmy awards for his iconic sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show and his variety show Van Dyke and Company. He also has a Tony Award and a Grammy. That means the longtime icon needs just the Oscar to make him an EGOT recipient.</p><p>In December 2023, Van Dyke joked that he “has been lucky” when it comes to the projects he’s done <a href=#>throughout his career</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“As a businessman, I’m not much good. I would do a movie and come home, and just sit down and wait for the phone to ring. I wasn’t aggressive,” Van Dyke shared in an interview on CBS’ Sunday Morning at the time. “I was out of work a lot because I didn’t go out and look for it.”</p><p>The Mary Poppins star shared that his “whole career has depended on” just having fun.</p><p>“If I’m not enjoying myself, I’m really bad,” he reflected. “It’s such a blessing to find a way of making a living that you love, that you’d do for nothing. I feel so sorry for people who hate their jobs. I look forward to going to work every morning.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuim5tiw6K6jJ2wpJ1dnLK1v4yepKaxXaO8rrXNmquip55irrV5mHFkn6eiYrGixdJmpp9ln6q%2FbrjIr5ysZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
