Here are the answers to 22 common questions related to the interaction between First Strike and Deathtouch:</p><h3>1. Can a creature with First Strike kill a creature with Deathtouch before it deals damage?</h3><p>Yes, a creature with First Strike will hit and potentially kill a creature with Deathtouch before it has a chance to deal damage.</p><h3>2. What happens if a creature with First Strike kills a creature with Deathtouch?</h3><p>If a creature with First Strike kills a creature with Deathtouch before it can deal damage, the Deathtouch creature will die and nothing happens to the First Strike creature.</p><h3>3. Does a creature with Deathtouch have to hit first in order for its ability to work?</h3><p>Yes, for the Deathtouch ability to activate, the creature must hit first in combat.</p><h3>4. Can a creature with First Strike or Double Strike kill a creature with Deathtouch before it can deal damage?</h3><p>Yes, if a creature with First Strike or Double Strike blocks a creature with Deathtouch, it will deal damage during the first strike damage step before the Deathtouch creature can return fire.</p><h3>5. How does First Strike and Deathtouch work with multiple blockers?</h3><p>A creature with both First Strike and Deathtouch can assign the minimal amount of damage to each blocker to destroy them. For example, if a creature with First Strike and Deathtouch is blocked by two creatures, it can assign just enough damage to each to destroy them.</p><h3>6. Does Deathtouch kill the damaged creature right away?</h3><p>Yes, if a creature with toughness greater than 0 is dealt damage by a source with Deathtouch, it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield immediately.</p><h3>7. Does Deathtouch cancel out another instance of Deathtouch?</h3><p>Yes, any two instances of the Deathtouch ability against one another will cancel out the Deathtouch ability. The creatures will deal damage to each other as normal.</p><h3>8. What is Deathtouch?</h3><p>Deathtouch is an ability that causes any amount of damage dealt by a creature with Deathtouch to be considered lethal damage. This means that even 1 damage can kill a creature with toughness greater than 0.</p><h3>9. What can stop or beat Deathtouch?</h3><p>Deathtouch can be stopped or beaten by removal spells that destroy creatures or deal damage to them. First Strike or Double Strike is also a powerful way to deal with Deathtouch creatures, as they can deal damage before the Deathtouch creature has a chance to retaliate. Indestructible creatures are another counter to Deathtouch because they cannot be destroyed.</p><h3>10. Does Hexproof stop Deathtouch?</h3><p>No, Hexproof does not stop Deathtouch. Deathtouch does not target creatures, so Hexproof does not prevent it. A creature with Hexproof can still be affected by Deathtouch.</p><h3>11. Will Deathtouch kill an indestructible creature?</h3><p>No, Deathtouch will not kill an indestructible creature. Indestructible creatures are not destroyed by lethal damage and are therefore immune to the effects of Deathtouch.</p><h3>12. Does Deathtouch break indestructible?</h3><p>No, Deathtouch does not break indestructible. Indestructible creatures are not destroyed by lethal damage and are therefore unaffected by Deathtouch.</p><h3>13. Does Deathtouch beat protection?</h3><p>Yes, Deathtouch beats protection. If all damage from a source is prevented due to protection, no effects that rely on dealing damage will occur, including Deathtouch.</p><h3>14. What is the first strike rule?</h3><p>The first strike rule states that a creature with First Strike will deal its damage before a creature without First Strike. This means that a creature with First Strike can potentially kill a creature without First Strike before it has a chance to deal damage.</p><h3>15. Does Deathtouch affect noncombat damage?</h3><p>Yes, Deathtouch affects any damage dealt by the source with Deathtouch, including noncombat damage. This means that spells or abilities that deal damage can also potentially kill creatures with Deathtouch.</p><h3>16. Does First Strike negate trample?</h3><p>No, First Strike does not negate trample. If an attacking creature with trample is blocked by a creature with First Strike, the First Strike creature will deal damage first, but the trample damage will still carry over to the defending player or planeswalker.</p><h3>17. Does a creature with shroud protect itself from spells and abilities?</h3><p>Yes, a creature with shroud cannot be the target of any spells or abilities, including its own. It is protected from being targeted by any spells or abilities, both from you and your opponents.</p><h3>18. What can destroy a creature with shroud?</h3><p>A creature with shroud can be destroyed by non-targeted spells or abilities that destroy or deal damage to all creatures, such as a board wipe or a sacrifice effect that forces the player to sacrifice a creature.</p><h3>19. Does Hexproof protect against proliferate?</h3><p>No, Hexproof does not protect against proliferate. Proliferate does not target creatures, so</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6dpp6rXZu2s7%2FTZqqtqpmgsm6vwKeanqRdmbKiwMetpq6bmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
