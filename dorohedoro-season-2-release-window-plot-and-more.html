It’s an odd show, there’s no denying it, but after four years, we definitely deserve the new season.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-dorohedoro-season-2-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is Dorohedoro season 2 coming out?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true><p lang=ja dir=ltr>🦎🥟🦎🥟🦎<br>おかえり、混沌。<br>🥟🦎🥟🦎🥟</p><p>アニメ『<a href=#>#ドロヘドロ</a>』が、配信シリーズとして、続編制作決定🎊<br>ティザービジュアルも公開です🎉</p><p>カイマンとニカイドウ達が織り成す「混沌」の世界が再び動き出します！</p><p>続報にぜひご期待ください！<a href=#>https://t.co/qcjvh0Aslp</a><a href=#>#それがドロヘドロ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8vrVk5lAgI</a></p>— TVアニメ『ドロヘドロ』 (@dorohedoro_PR) <a href=#>January 9, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>While the official Dorohedoro website and Twitter have finally announced that season 2 is underway, they have yet to confirm a release date — or even a release window for that matter. However, we can certainly speculate about when the new season featuring the Hungry Bug restaurant will come to our screens.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>Dorohedoro season 1 aired from January to March 2020. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">news of the sequel was only recently announced</a>, indicating that the likelihood of it reaching our screens by the spring season is… well, highly unlikely. However, considering MAPPA’s past release schedules, it typically takes about six months to a year before new seasons are released. Hopefully, we can expect season 2 of Dorohedoro to premiere before 2024 — perhaps even during the winter lineup. Fingers crossed.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What can we expect from Dorohedoro season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Nikaido-Dorohedoro.jpg><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>Season 1 of Dorohedoro covered a total of seven volumes and 36 chapters, and while the story isn’t necessarily separated between arcs, we can already anticipate what’s coming. In the upcoming season, the series will likely focus on the Central Department Store arc, and from Chapter 37 onwards, the anime will have plenty to adapt.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Caiman will once again lead the story as he continues his pursuit of his memories and identity, but he won’t be the only one getting the spotlight. Nikaido is finally relinquishing her time-traveling powers, and we’ll be exploring her devil side at long last. In the second season, we will also finally see and hear Haru (cue in my shrieks), you’ll meet the best boy Kawajari, and of course, Dokuga.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What do we know about Dorohedoro season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dorohedoro.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>Truthfully, we know very little about the second season of Dorohedoro. Aside from what we already know needs to be adapted — considering they’re aiming to faithfully depict events from the manga — only poster art has been released alongside the announcement. The season is still in production, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MAPPA has gone through quite a tumultuous 2023</a>, so it will likely be some time before more news emerges.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=false>However, we can now rest assured knowing that a second season is confirmed at long last. The first season earned Dorohedoro a nomination for the 2021 5th Crunchyroll Anime Awards, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it deservedly received plenty of praise from several critics</a>. They tirelessly lauded the show for its perfect balance of absurdity and comedy, all while maintaining the element of dark fantasy. Yes, it certainly deserves a second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6dpqunmJqxsL7OZqqemaOku25%2BjKucpZ2RqLJuw8inm6ivXaW5sMCMmqWdZZ2kv6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
