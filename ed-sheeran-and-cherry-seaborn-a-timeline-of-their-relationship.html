Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn have kept their love life out of the spotlight — but the couple’s low-key relationship still makes fans swoon.
The “Shape of You” singer first met Seaborn when they were kids in Sheffield, England, but the pair didn’t start dating until 2015.
Sheeran told Us Weekly that he reunited with the financial advisor in New York City thanks to a “mutual friend” who was working on his tour."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After he was spotted wearing a silver band on his ring finger in August 2018, he told Access Hollywood that he would “never really do anything too public anyway.”</p><p>However, the Yesterday actor finally revealed that he had <a href=#>wed his longtime love</a> on his 2019 album, No.6 Collaborations Project. He called Seaborn his “wife” in his song “Remember the Name.” Sheeran wrote the track “before me and Cherry got married and I knew that we’d be married by the point that the song came out,” he told <strong>Charlamagne tha God</strong>.</p><p>Sheeran and Seaborn went on to welcome a <a href=#>daughter named <strong>Lyra Antarctica</strong></a> in August 2020. “We are on cloud nine over here,” he wrote via Instagram following <a href=#>the birth of his little girl</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Lyra’s middle name</a> is a sweet nod to where the couple vacationed before they learned they were expecting. “Me and Cherry always wanted to go to Antarctica, it was always on our list. So, we went there and it’s just an amazing place, it’s really special to us, and obviously, like, we got home and <a href=#>Cherry was pregnant</a>,” <a href=#>the “Thinking Out Loud” singer</a> said in a 2021 interview with U.K.’s Hits Radio.</p><p>He continued, “I know people see it as a weird thing, but … it’s less about where she was made and more about it being special. I just wanted to have a connection to it.”</p><p class=p1>The “Collide” musician and Seaborn <a href=#>secretly welcomed their second child</a> in 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Want to let you all know we’ve&nbsp;had another beautiful baby girl,” Sheehan <a href=#>wrote via Instagram that May</a>, sharing a photo of&nbsp;a knit blanket and baby-sized socks. “We are both so in love with her, and over the moon to be a family of 4.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to look back at some of Sheeran and Seaborn’s sweetest moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksqV50qGcnqqRo3qiusNmmqGdoqfGbr%2FEmpmoqp5irm7AyKacpaGemnqwsoytn56homK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
