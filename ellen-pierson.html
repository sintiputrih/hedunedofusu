Robert died six weeks after their wedding. He divorced his second wife, Jan Ashley, in 1998 after the marriage was annulled after 30 days. After the wedding, Robert began dating Ellen Piersen in 1998. In later interviews, the entrepreneur revealed that the couple had been dating for nearly three years when Robert proposed in 2001.</p><p>After waiting another year, the couple married in a private ceremony in 2003, just six weeks before Robert Kardashian died. The bulk of the Kardashian children claims Ellen married their father on his deathbed while he was unconscious. They also accuse her of forging their father’s will at the time.</p><h2><span id=Children8217s>Children’s</span></h2><p>The rumor about Khloe Kardashian’s true parentage started here, and it still lingers today. Some people believe O.J. Simpson is Khloe Kardashian’s biological father, rather than Robert Kardashian.

You should be ashamed of yourselves! I’ve slacked on a lot of things in the past, but this one is especially low… YOU ARE THE WORST!

Robert wrote about Kris and Kim’s relationship in the lines, where Kim was purportedly threatened by Kris and the word “kill” was used once.</p><p>Regardless of the legality of the passages, the publication of the private records resulted in a lawsuit, in which Kris demanded that the journal be returned to her because it was her daughters’ property. She received the journal as well as a percentage of the earnings from the sale of the diary’s contents when the court agreed.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><ul><li>Pierson countersued the Kardashians, saying that their case was just a plot for a Keeping Up with the Kardashians program.</li><li>Gemini is the zodiac sign of Robert’s ex-wife.</li><li>Following Pierson’s slanderous remarks regarding Khloe’s biological father, the model asked OJ Simpson for a paternity test.</li><li>On a broadcast episode of the Kardashians, Pierson’s disputed sale of Robert’s diaries was discussed.</li><li>Ellen Pierson’s stepchildren are Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian.</li></ul><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity family</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Adnis Reeves</a></h3>Adnis Reeves estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
