The King started dating Priscilla Presley when she was merely 14, and he was 24. Already this is an enormous red flag, one that often gets glossed over.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_50>Presley met Priscilla in Germany while he was serving for the military in 1959. They dated for quite some time, until Priscilla moved in with Elvis in 1962, when she was only 16. This, of course, came only after Anita Wood realized he’d been cheating on her with the 14-year-old.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_20>Priscilla Presley has since claimed that Elvis Presley never had sex with her, at least not until they were married.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_60>“There was an agreement he made with himself that the woman he decided to take for his wife he was going to keep her that way until he married her… I can only go back to his concept of what he wanted in a woman. Somewhere in his past, he said he wanted a virgin.,” Priscilla Presley told Barbara Walters.</p><p id=par-6_18>Apparently Elvis lost all sexual interest in Priscilla after they had their first child. The two eventually split.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elvis Presley supposedly toured with underage girls&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/elvispresley2.jpg><p id=par-7_35>Priscilla Presley isn’t the only instance of Elvis Presley engaging in sexual or bizarre activity with underage girls. In Elvis Presley: A Southern Life, author Joel Williamson claims Presley brought children with him on tour.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_47>Williamson explains that while on tour, Elvis brought along three 14-year-olds who he would urge to wrestle, tickle, and kiss him. Presley also dated several minors, including Dixie Locke, who was 15 when they dated — Presley was 22. This came before he started seeing Priscilla Presley.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_16>Unfortunately, these weren’t the only examples of Presley engaging in relationships and sexual activities with children.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elvis has had other underage relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/elvispresley3.jpg><p id=par-10_37>One of the first recorded instances of Elvis Presley engaging in sexual activity with children is in 1956. Talent manager Tom Parker helped hook Elvis up with a stream of pageant queens, many of whom were underage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_57>Jackie Rowland, who was 14 at the time, met Presley in 1956, and he invited her backstage. Presley took Rowland off to a separate room, and her mother later <a href=#>opened the door</a> to find him showing her how to ‘kiss in a grown-up way.’ He then asked her if he could take her child to a bar.</p><p id=par-12_19>Later, Presley had a coterie of underage girls, including Frances Forbes, who earned his attention when she turned 14.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_31>“He didn’t pay any attention to me [when I was 13], but when I was 14, he noticed me. Fourteen was a magical age with Elvis. It really was,” she said.</p><p id=par-14_35>She was invited, along with her fellow 14-year-old friends Gloria Mowel and Heidi Heissen, to join Presley for private parties in his bedroom, during which he would wrestle with them, tickle them, and kiss them.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrcLIrGSpqpWouabFjKysqaifqLKluNhmq6itopqxbsPIrZ9mrZ6ZsrOtxp5koKGiocBvtNOmo2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
