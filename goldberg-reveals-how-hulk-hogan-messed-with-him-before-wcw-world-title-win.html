I wanted to eat him more than anybody in the business. Then I had to go with Hogan and I’m scared sh*tless. I don’t know what’s going on. I just do whatever people tell me to do anyway and here I got Hogan.”</p><p>“I go in and say, ‘What are we doing?’ And he goes, ‘We’ll call it in the ring’ — you’re kidding me right?! So then we go [in the match] and lock up and [he’s got] Icy Hot all over him everywhere — hell yeah — I couldn’t see the whole freaking match. It is what it is, I deserved it — it’s all good.”</p><p>It’s unclear whether Hulk Hogan meant to spread Icy Hot all over Goldberg’s face, but it happened. They also apparently called the famous match on the spot.</p><p>If you use our quotes credit <a href=#>Ringside News</a></p><p>December 25, 2019 3:43 pm</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
