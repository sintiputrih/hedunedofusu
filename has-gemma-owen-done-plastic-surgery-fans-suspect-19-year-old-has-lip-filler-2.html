Thus, we’re here to refute those rumors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=has-gemma-owen-done-plastic-surgery></span>Has Gemma Owen Done Plastic Surgery?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Gemma Owen’s appearance on Love Island 2022, fans are speculating about her plastic surgery.</p><p>The celebrity is barely 19 years old, yet admirers believe she has already worked.</p><p>Many admirers believe she has had filler in her lips, as well as botox in her jaw and cheeks. Gemma has neither confirmed nor denied this. One Love Island fan said on Twitter, “Gemma 19 wtf?”</p><p>“Can so much surgery be completed in a year, presuming she began at the age of 18? There is a serious concern.</p><p>In addition to her surgery rumor, people are also talking about her effort in recognizing herself as the daughter of Michael Owens.</p><p>Gemma is the youngest of four children born to Michael Owen and Louise Bonsall. Despite her professional achievements and notoriety, she is most known for being the daughter of Michael, the former world’s greatest player.</p><p>However, it looked that the Islanders had no idea who she was.</p><p>Gemma mentioned her surname several times during a name debate, but none of her fellow Islanders spotted the link. With her name drop, many were certain Gemma was keen to uncover her father’s identity, while earlier in the program she also hinted about her ties to football.</p><p>Fans were amused by Gemma’s repeated mention of her surname, which was met with silence from the other cast members.</p><p>She has received a lot of criticism for her “bad attitude,” with viewers calling her “nasty” and “rude.” Former Love Island participants Marcel Somerville, Amber Gill, and Chloe Burrows were not impressed with her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gemma-owens-lip-filler-and-nose-job-after-comparing-her-before-and-after-photos></span>Gemma Owen’s Lip Filler And Nose Job After Comparing Her Before And After Photos<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans are comparing Gemma Owen’s before and after photos, concluding that she has undergone lip filler and nose surgery. However, she has never revealed about the cosmetic surgery herself.</p><p>Her first Instagram post was in 2008 where we can see her flawless beauty with a great facial structure.</p><p>Either she has had surgery before, as everyone has indicated, or she has been blessed by God with such amazing features.</p><p>It’s every girl’s desire is to have such significant lips, highlighted cheekbones, and a sharp jawline.</p><p>Though we can observe some tiny changes in the size of her lips and nose, with advancements in make-up, we cannot simply attribute the alteration to surgery.</p><p>Moreover, Geema has always been remarkable. She has always enjoyed getting dressed up and applying make-up, and she still does.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gemma-owen-is-getting-backlash-after-her-love-island></span>Gemma Owen Is Getting Backlash After Her Love Island<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following her Love island debut, Gemma Owen experienced anger from fans who labeled her “mannerless” for her “bad attitude.” It caused her odds at the bookies to plummet.</p><p>While Gemma is in Majorca, her family has been working behind the scenes to raise her reputation. They are signing her up to the specialized PR agency that represents past finalist Maura Higgins, 31.</p><p>Gemma’s image is currently being managed by Off Limits Entertainment.</p><p>The news almost certainly has wrecked her father Michael’s day.</p><p>The 42-year-old analyst was part of the squad presenting England’s match versus Germany on Tuesday night.</p><p>He said that the only thing keeping his attention off his adolescent daughter snogging older men on TV was football.</p><p>In the opening round of the series, Gemma was with Italian stallion Davide Sanclimenti, 27. The couple left the Majorcan villa and went to a fruit field to toast their marriage with a drink of lemonade.</p><p>She was labeled nasty by fans earlier this week after snubbing her first boyfriend, Liam Llewellyn, 22.</p><p>“I and Davide are now in a relationship, which I’m quite happy about,” Gemma remarked. “I’m overjoyed, and I’m looking forward to getting to know him better and seeing where it leads.”</p><p>The couple exited the villa and made their way to a gorgeous wood for their romantic rendezvous.</p><p>The topic quickly shifted to marriage, with Davide asking, “Do you want to get married? Have you ever considered it?”</p><p>“Definitely,” Gemma answered. I want to get married and have children. “About four!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCRqHqoscymmGanp5q7brDOp5xmqJyWwLW1wmaqrqqXmr%2B6ecWapaxlo6rAsbHCrWRqcV2usqK%2BjKijnWWYlsBuuMipZJ%2BhnKGys3mRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
