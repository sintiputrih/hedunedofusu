It was meant to be an example for parents everywhere of the ideal template for the “superior race.”</p><p>Little did they know, the girl was actually Jewish.</p><p>The photographer, Hans Ballin of Berlin, originally snapped the image in late 1934 as a standard baby photo for Taft’s parents to keep. But then, he secretly submitted her photo to the magazine’s Aryan beauty contest — and she won.</p><p>But Hessy Levinsons Taft’s incredible story doesn’t end there. In 1990, she detailed her entire journey for the <a href=#>United States Holocaust Museum</a>.</p><p>The story begins when Taft’s parents, Jacob and Pauline Levinsons, came to Berlin in 1928 — just a few years before Hitler took power.</p><p>The young couple, who were both Latvian Jews, dreamed of becoming famous singers. But with anti-Semitism on the rise, they couldn’t get work. Broke and living in a tiny apartment, they gave birth to their soon-to-be-famous daughter on May 17, 1934.</p><p>“My mother took me to a photographer, one of the best in Berlin!” Taft recounted. “And he did — he made a very beautiful picture — which my parents thought was very beautiful.”</p><p>The proud parents propped the photo up on display in their home. They were understandably surprised when, a short time later, one visitor said she recognized it from a magazine.</p><p>In disbelief, Pauline asked the woman to buy her a copy. And sure enough, there was her daughter’s face on the cover.</p><p>Horrified to see their baby girl on the cover of a prominent Nazi magazine, they called Ballin. He told the frantic Pauline to calm down.</p><p>“I will tell you the following,” Taft says he told her mother. “I was asked to submit my 10 best pictures for a beauty contest run by the Nazis. So were 10 other outstanding photographers in Germany. So 10 photographers submitted their 10 best pictures. And I sent in your baby’s picture.”</p><p>They were trying, he went on, to find the “perfect example of the Aryan race to further Nazi philosophy.”</p><p>Pauline was still confused. Ballin had been well aware that Taft was Jewish.</p><p>“Yes,” he agreed. “I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke. And you see, I was right. Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect Aryan.”</p><p>“I wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous,” Ballin said.</p><p>The photo continued to spread and the family took a secret pleasure in the irony of it. For Taft’s first birthday, her aunt even bought her a card with her own face on it.</p><p>Taft settled in the United States in the late 1940s. She went on to get married and become a chemistry professor at St. John’s University in New York. Now 83, she’s still on the university’s faculty.</p><p>Eventually, Taft’s family fled to Cuba, where they were faced with another dictator.</p><p>“‘I have survived Hitler; I will survive Castro,'” Taft remembers her father saying. “And he did. He did.”</p><p>In 2014, Taft presented the original magazine cover that her mother had bought to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel.</p><p>“I can laugh about it now,” she said. “But if the Nazis had known who I really was, I wouldn’t be alive.”</p><p>After learning about Hessy Levinsons Taft, the not so perfect Aryan baby, read about <a href=#>Julian Bilecki</a>, the teenager who saved dozens of Jews from Nazi death squads.
