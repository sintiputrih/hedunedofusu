The captivating Netflix show swept in every category it was nominated in, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">each award was well-earned</a>.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>The Emmy Awards are like to follow in suit, and each fresh award urges new viewers to set sights on the incredible limited series. Its stars are likewise earning fresh acclaim, as dazzled viewers walk away from the show as Yeun and Wong fans. Both stars have lengthy, and successful, careers behind them, with notable work on either side.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-steven-yeun-and-ali-wong-s-net-worths data-injectable=false>What are Steven Yeun and Ali Wong’s net worths?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>You may not know their names by heart, but you’ve likely heard at least one or two Ali Wong jokes, and everyone‘s heard of The Walking Dead. Zombies may not be your thing, but even newcomers can likely <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recognize Yeun’s character, Glenn</a>, on sight.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>That’s on top of their other work. Wong has a three Netflix comedy specials under her belt, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slew of television shows</a> — including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2022’s Paper Girls</a> and the animated Big Mouth — and several film appearances to her credit.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Yeun’s work in The Walking Dead is easily his best known, but its far from his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only prominent project</a>. He’s discovered a real talent for voice acting — appearing as the lead character in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video’s Invincible</a> and the Tales of Arcadia collection — and he’s been in several dozen various film and television projects, many of which display his incredible range.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>That work, and several years of additional experience on top of Wong’s — not to mention those good old Hollywood pay discrepancies — has earned Yeun a slightly higher net worth. All that may be set to change, as new creators recognize and cash in on Wong’s clear talent, but for now Yeun is worth a good $1 million more than his Beef co-star. His net worth currently stands at around $5 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and Wong’s is a touch lower <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">at $4 million</a>.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Both Yeun and Wong are likely to see those bank accounts bulk up in the coming years, as their incredible performances (and those awards wins) earn them more and more profitable roles. Within a few years, we should be seeing the stars everywhere, and they should see those net worths doubling and tripling. Sounds like a win for everyone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMnaaeq12Wuap51qiloKtdo7K1edaoqa2gXZi8rrzAq5xmrJ9iwLWx1Z6lZrGVqru0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
