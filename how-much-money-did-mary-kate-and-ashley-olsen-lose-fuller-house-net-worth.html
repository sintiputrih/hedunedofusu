As soon as the reboot was announced, fans realized that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen wouldn't be part of it. It was great to see D.J. and Stephanie Tanner as adults. And Kimmy Gibbler was as hilarious and offbeat as ever. But there was definitely something missing... and that was the Olsen twins. While there is a line of dialogue that says that Michelle is a fashion designer, it would have been great to actually see Michelle in these new episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Fuller House cast has high net worths</a>. And there's no doubt that the Olsen twins have a lot of money, too. When Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen said no to Fuller House, did they miss out on a great salary?</p><h2 id=what-would-mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-have-been-paid-for-fuller-house>What Would Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen Have Been Paid For Fuller House?</h2><p>The Olsen twins definitely made good money playing Michelle Tanner on Full House. And this likely gave them the confidence and cushion to <a href=#>stop acting and become fashion designers</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have a net worth of $500 million. Part of that comes from Full House. The twins also made money from movies like</p><p>Cosmopolitan reported that Mary-Kate and Ashley were paid $80,000 for several Full House episodes. Before that, they were paid $25,000 for each episode. And before that, they only made $2,400 for each episode. Since they were babies when they were cast on Full House, that is definitely impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Full-House.jpg><p>Would the Olsen twins have made a fortune if they said yes to starring in Fuller House? It does seem like Netflix would have paid them well.</p><p>According to Parade, Jodie Sweetin made $26,000 for every Fuller House episode. The website notes that the actress could have made at least $1,976,000 since Fuller House has 76 episodes. It was fun seeing Sweetin reprise her role as the adorable Stephanie Tanner. And it turns out that she was paid well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen's Life Now Couldn't Be More Different Than When They Were Famous</a></span></p><p>It's possible that the rest of the Fuller House cast made the same. And it's possible that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen would have also earned this salary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen.jpg><p>However, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are incredibly successful fashion designers. According to Robert Burke Associates, The Row's annual sales figures are $100 million-$200 million. That is absolutely amazing. While there is no way of knowing what Mary-Kate and Ashley would have made from Fuller House, it's possible to say that their salary would never match those figures.</p><p>The twins definitely continue to earn a lot of money from their fashion lines. Go Banking Rates reported in 2018 that their net worth was $400 million. And since the Olsen twins now have a net worth of $500 million, they have continued to make tons of money. Besides The Row and Elizabeth and James, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen also have a line called Olsenboye. This line is sold at JCPenney and the clothing is at a lower price point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-were-mary-kate-and-ashley-not-in-fuller-house>Why Were Mary-Kate And Ashley Not In Fuller House?</h2><p>It seems like the Olsen twins are happy to be out of the acting world. Fans may have fond memories of their direct-to-video movies like To Grandmother's House We Go and Billboard Dad. But the twins began acting when they were babies and stopped when they were young adults.</p><p>Fans were surprised that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Olsen twins said no to Fuller House</a>. But they have definitely made it clear that they don't want to act anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mary-kate-ashley-olsen-1.jpg><p>According to People, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were busy working on Elizabeth and James and The Row. And stepping onto a TV set just didn't make sense.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mary-Kate Olsen Doesn't Wish Her Upbringing On Anyone, And Compared It To The Army</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turns out that perhaps Mary-Kate would have come back and played Michelle Tanner all on her own. But it just didn't work out.</p><p>Bob Boyett, an executive producer on Fuller House, explained to People in an interview, “Ashley said, ‘I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don’t feel comfortable acting.' Mary-Kate said, It would have to be me because Ash doesn’t want to do it. But the timing is so bad for us.”</p><p>According to Insider.com, John Stamos said, "I remember trying to get them on 'Fuller House' and they didn't want to come in or there was some miscommunication, or whatever it was — it was blown out of proportion."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mary-kate-ashley-olsen.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's interesting that at the time that Fuller House was announced, Mary-Kate Olsen seemed more open to acting than Ashley is. After the twins starred in New York Minute in 2007, Mary-Kate played Molly Spence in the 2006 movie Factory Girl about Edie Sedgwick.</p><p>She then played the memorable part of Unity in the 2008 comedy The Wackness. Mary-Kate's most recent film role was Kendra Hilferty in the 2011 movie Beastly, a romantic drama that is based on Beauty and the Beast.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Mary-Kate Olsen's Ex-Husband Age Bother The Rest Of Her Family?</a></span></p><p>Mary-Kate also has some TV credits to her name. In season 3 of the dark comedy Weeds, she played Tara Lindman. And in 2008, she guest-starred in one episode of the sitcom Samantha Who? which starred Christina Applegate as a woman who lost her memory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Elle Magazine, Mary-Kate Olsen explained that it was tough for her to go on auditions. She said, "My whole thing is being who I am, and in that regard, it works against me in a lot of ways going on auditions. People expect one thing from me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-new-york-minute.jpg><p>Mary-Kate continued to Elle, "I'm not sure. Most of the time the feedback I get is, I can't believe she was the way she was, that she was normal. I just don't think they know what to expect, exactly."</p><p>It doesn't seem very likely that Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen would ever act in the future. In various interviews, they have made it clear that they are done with that part of their life. And they have also shared that they don't want people to pay that much attention to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMppirsV2grrWxjJqlnWWRqLWtsdhmpqWrlaN6rbvSnmSfrZyhsrN5x6isrJ1do7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
