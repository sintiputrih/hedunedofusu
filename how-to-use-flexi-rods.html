They come in a variety of lengths and sizes to accommodate a multitude of hair types.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-frizz></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Frizz:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you use flexi-rods on wet hair, make sure your strands are freshly washed and thoroughly conditioned. While a gel may give too much of a strong hold, a lightweight mousse can help to curb frizz and add hold — without the stiffness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you use flexi-rods on dry hair, ensure your hair has been blown out with a smoothing cream beforehand. And don't worry, it doesn't have to be bone-straight.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-flexi-rods-on-wet-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Flexi-Rods on Wet Hair</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 1: Wash and Condition</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whenever you style your hair, always start with a clean slate. So, go ahead and grab your favorite cleanser and deep conditioner, then get your wash day started.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 2: Styling Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once your hair has been prepped and is ready, reach for your favorite leave-in, oil, or your favorite hydrating hair product. Next, grab a mousse or setting lotion and apply it to the hair section by section as tis will help to define the curls — just make sure to use it after your other products. We're fans of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Afro Sheen's Texture Flexing Foam</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 3: Wrapping the Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you're ready, grab a small section of hair (this will vary based on your own hair's thickness) and wrap it taut around the flexi-rod. Once finished, bend the rod around the roots and ends of the hair to secure it in place.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 4: Drying and Styling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once all of the rods are in, you can either let your hair air dry (which is the best option if you want to avoid heat), or you can go under a hooded dryer to speed up the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterwards, carefully unwrap the hair, section by section, and fluff out your roots with a pick. You can also finger comb each section to add more volume, or leave the curls as is — it's totally up to you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Curl Your Hair Without Using Heat</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-flexi-rods-on-dry-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Flexi-Rods on Dry Hair</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 1: Wash, Condition, and Stretch the Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As always, you want to start off on freshly washed hair. After cleansing, do a chunky twist-out or braid-out and let air dry to stretch the hair. You can also use a blow dry brush if you're in a rush.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 2: Styling Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since your hair will already be dry, you'll want to avoid water-based foams or setting lotions that will lead you back to step one. Instead, use a styling butter or cream to help add moisture and set the style. Apply this product to the hair in small sections.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 3: Wrapping the Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As seen in the first tutorial, you want to wrap the hair taut around the rods section by section. Once you're done, bend the top and ends of the flexi-rods to hold the hair in place.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 4: Drying and Styling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once your hair is ready, let it set overnight for best results. When you wake up, gently unravel the hair and fluff with a pick. Separate the curls as much or as little as you'd like to create your desired looked.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-do-i-do-if-my-hair-comes-out-frizzy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Do I Do If My Hair Comes Out Frizzy?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You applaud your hair for doing what it does naturally and let it be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if this wasn't the look you were trying to go for, you can never go wrong when wearing your hair in a fluffy afro.
