Whether it was getting ready for a formal ball, or simply running errands on the street, she always looked incredibly chic. Her looks will be copied for years to come, and all the trends she rocked have a habit of coming back into fashion every few years. In particular, she had a real way with denim.

Mix Casual & Formalwear</h2><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Shutterstock</p></figure><p>One thing Diana loved doing with her denim is mix and matching it for all sorts of occasions. Take this look for example: she's rocking pale casual denim with informal blue sneakers, along with a super smart blazer. It's the perfect high-low situation.</p><p>4. Wear With A Bomber Jacket & Cowboy Boots</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Shutterstock</p></figure><p>Pairing western boots with a retro-style jacket may not sound like it should work, but Diana makes it look easy.
