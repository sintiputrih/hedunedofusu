The ground was leveled, irrigation installed, perfect turf, goals raised." The former high-level Scientology executive added, "A full-time caretaker was appointed from the Gold staff ... It was built for one purpose only: so Tom Cruise could woo his friend David to come to Gold. It never happened." <a href=#>Beckham, who is worth $450 million,</a> is probably not easily swayed.</p><p>The famous footballer likely didn't join Scientology because he identifies with the Jewish faith, which he spoke about in 2016.&nbsp;"My grandfather was Jewish ...&nbsp;and every time we went to synagogue I was a part of that," he explained, per <a href=#>Tablet</a>.&nbsp;According to <a href=#>The Jewish Chronicle,</a>&nbsp;his son Brooklyn Beckham married Nicola Peltz in a Jewish wedding ceremony. While neither the bride nor the groom were Jewish, Peltz's father is Jewish, and the British football star identifies as such thanks to his grandfather. The father of the groom even read a Hebrew blessing at the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhibIR3hI6hprBlpKS6bq%2FRrqCsnV2nsrG70a2cnaSpYsGztcSdZK2nXajEosWMnZivoZRir6avyqGYpmWkpMSivsNmqpyhlaPBsLjOoLBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
