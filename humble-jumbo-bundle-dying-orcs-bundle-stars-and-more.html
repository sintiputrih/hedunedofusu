I actually bought this bundle while I was away on Thanksgiving vacation, but it still has a week left and this is definitely one you should buy. The current average price is only $4.21 and you get nine games, many of which are worth more than $5 on their own. The full list consists of <a href=#>Natural Selection 2</a>, <a href=#>Sanctum 2</a>, and <a href=#>Magicka</a> (with "<a href=#>Vietnam</a>" and "Dungeons and Daemons" DLC), which is a reasonable starting point. If you pay more than the average price, however, you'll also receive <a href=#>Orcs Must Die! GOTY</a>, <a href=#>Orcs Must Die! 2: Complete Pack</a>, <a href=#>Sanctum: Collection</a>, Garry’s Mod, <a href=#>Cities in Motion 2</a>, and <a href=#>Serious Sam 3: BFE</a>, which is pretty insane. There are also soundtracks for six of the games available (Orcs Must Die!, Cities in Motion 2, and Garry's Mod being the exceptions).</p><p>Since I missed mentioning it last week, I'm also going to bring up the current <a href=#>Humble Weekly</a>, which has ten indie titles for $6. The core seven games are <a href=#>OddPlanet</a>, Splotches, <a href=#>Faerie Solitaire</a>, <a href=#>MANOS: The Hands of Fate</a>, <a href=#>Vincere Totus Astrum</a>, and <a href=#>Pitiri 1977</a>. You also get the game-creation software Multimedia Fusion 2, which was apparently used to create these six games. Pay $6 or more and you’ll also receive <a href=#>Knytt Underground</a>, <a href=#>NightSky</a>, and <a href=#>Really Big Sky</a>. Nearly all of the games are available as DRM-free releases. Those who like Steam can also get Faerie Solitaire, Knytt Underground, NightSky, and Really Big Sky on that platform (with three of those four – Really Big Sky being the exception – also being available for OS X). And Android users also get a few bonuses, as MANOS and Nightsky versions for that OS are included.</p><p>Still need more options for some indie gaming goodness? I received an email from another company similar to Humble Bundle that has several bundles all going on right now. The company is <a href=#>Bundle Stars</a> (based in the UK), and while it's not a “name your own price and/or give to charity” site, they have six current bundles that range in price from $2.50 up to $4.01, with one other bundle being priced at a hefty $8.99 (yes, that's tongue-in-cheek). Some of the games are older, some are probably not that great, but at less than $1 per game it's hard to complain. The current six bundles going on are the <a href=#>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</a> (nine vehicular games for $4.01), <a href=#>Indie Capsule Bundle</a> (seven indie games for $3.50), <a href=#>The Outer Limits</a> (ten games for $4.01), <a href=#>Ultimate Sci-Fi</a> (eight games for $3.50), <a href=#>Superpower Sims</a> (nine simulation games for $8.99), <a href=#>FPS Warrior</a> (six FPS shooters for $3.50), and <a href=#>Blaze of Glory</a> (six strategy games for $2.50). The bundles have anywhere from seven to 28 days remaining, and if you missed some of these games at launch and want to give them a shot this is the modern day bargain-bin, with Steam codes available for all of the games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIR2g5Zon66lkqGybrbUppmoZZKqu6W4xGabsqGenHqwvsKsZJutnpm5pnnSrZirq12Wu6V5zKipng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
