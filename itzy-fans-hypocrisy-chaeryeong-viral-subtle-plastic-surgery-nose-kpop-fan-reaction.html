She looks the same but different at the same time. I don’t know why people thought she was ugly. It’s sad now people praise her after PS when she was always pretty.” One fan added, “She looks different indeed but what makes her become really attractive lately is her confidence. She used to get hate bcs of her look so its obvious after she did some tweaks for her features, she naturally feels more confident with herself.
