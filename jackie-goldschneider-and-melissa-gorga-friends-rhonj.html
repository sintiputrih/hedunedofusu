The new friendship has taken the rest of the Real Housewives of New Jersey cast by surprise, especially Melissa Gorga."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The new friendship has taken the rest of the <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> cast by surprise, especially <a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a>. Melissa and Teresa have been feuding for well over a decade at this point, and the theme of Season 14 appears to be all about loyalty. This has already been seen with <a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Fessler</a>, and now fans are seeing it with Melissa and Jackie.</p><p>Jackie was demoted to a friend role during Season 13 of RHONJ due to personal issues. She later shared that it was a <a href=#>mutual decision</a> between her and <a href=#>Bravo</a> for her mental and physical health. During Season 12, she was incredibly candid about her struggles with anorexia and made a joint decision. Now that she's friends with Teresa, Melissa believes Jackie has ulterior motives. Where does Jackie Goldschneider stand with Melissa Gorga now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Jackie Goldschneider and Melissa Gorga still friends?</h2><p>During a June 2024 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Melissa got candid about the whole situation that's currently playing out in Season 14 surrounding the burgeoning friendship with Teresa. While she is shocked by her friend's <a href=#>sudden alliance</a> with her sister-in-law and sworn enemy, she bares Jackie no ill will. She shared, “I don't hate Jackie ... I'm just shocked by her, and I would say disappointed, and I can't believe she chose that route,” Melissa shared.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Melissa's confusion is valid, as Teresa has not been good to Jackie in the past.</h2><p>The friendship between Jackie and Teresa is pretty surprising, considering the rumors Teresa had spread about her marriage in the past. Teresa <a href=#>sparked a rumor</a> in the Season 11 premiere that Jackie's husband was sleeping with people at his gym. Making matters worse was that she did this at his birthday party. Jackie was deeply hurt at the time, and Melissa was one of the people who was there for her in her time of need. Now, Melissa thinks that Jackie has ulterior motives for befriending Teresa.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Melissa thinks that Jackie is using Teresa for personal gain.</h2><p>During the People interview, Melissa also hinted that there are specific reasons why Jackie decided to cozy up to Teresa. Melissa hinted that true <a href=#>fans of the show will see through</a> Jackie's actions. There are fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">theories</a> suggesting that Jackie simply wants more on-camera time, as she is still stuck in a friend role. Jackie has brushed these rumors off, insisting that Teresa provides the positive energy that she's focused on having in her life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The 'RHONJ' cast has become so divided that Bravo canceled the Season 14 reunion.</h2><p>According to <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a>, things <a href=#>will not follow the usual Bravo formula</a> for the end of Season 14 of RHONJ. Typically, the reunions are used as an opportunity to hash out unfinished business and resolve any leftover issues. However, as seen from the previous season's reunion special, resolution is hard to come by with this group. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy said</a>, "When all of us producers saw the last cut of the finale, we all came to the decision separately, and then we talked. We all had the same thought, which is the finale is kind of the finale and the reunion all in one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66kt8ieZKCnnJnApLTNnqCdnaJirq%2BwjKacpaGjqK5us86rnppllqe2prrDrGSroJ%2Bjtw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
