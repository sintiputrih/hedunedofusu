Swifties have speculated for years that the song was about Jake, whom Taylor dated for three months in 2010 before she released the song on her album Red.</p><p>At long last, Jake has addressed the matter.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“It has nothing to do with me. It’s about her relationship with her fans,”</a> he said in an interview with Esquire. “It is her expression. Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don’t begrudge anyone that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Taylor Swift And Leonardo DiCaprio Have A Secret Feud?</a></span></p><h2 id=jake-gyllenhaal-thinks-swifties-really-need-to-calm-down-and-stop-asking-him-about-that-scarf>Jake Gyllenhaal Thinks Swifties Really Need To Calm Down And Stop Asking Him About That Scarf.</h2><p>When asked about the fan response to the song, and if it had impacted his life, Jake said, “At some point, I think it’s important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one’s name.”</p><p>The actor took a long pensive pause before continuing, “That begs for a deeper philosophical question. Not about any individual, per se, but a conversation that allows us to examine how we can—or should, even—take responsibility for what we put into the world, our contributions into the world. How do we provoke a conversation? We see that in politics. There’s anger and divisiveness, and it’s literally life-threatening in the extreme.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Taylor Swift And Ed Sheeran's Friendship</a></span></p><p>A scarf mentioned in the lyrics of the song <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has become something of a fabled accessory.</a> Media outlets have claimed it was originally lost at the house of Jake’s sisters, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. <a href=#>Taylor never got her scarf back</a>, and its whereabouts have become a pop culture mystery, with many agreeing that the legendary scarf has become more than a simple piece of outerwear.</p><p>The scarf has become a symbol in Swift's fandom, inspiring jokes, memes, and interview questions.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Parents’ Separation Deeply Affected Her Music And Career, Here's How</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqOVYrS6uMuepaGZkaF6p7XNmqOlsV2WsaW%2BxKyqnqtdmsVuwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTZpilpF2pvLB51p6jpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
