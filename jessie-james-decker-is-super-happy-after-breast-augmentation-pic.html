I loved getting to know my babies while growing inside of me each time and learning their personalities, which turned out to be true when they came out. I sure do love being a Mommy. Happy birthday eve little wild child Forrest. Life is better with you in it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnaOotqZ5yZqknqtdmbKkt8SrZKKrXajCsbHRZp%2BaqKCueqKy056pZpqimq60wIyarKCllaPBosDIqKVmqJmYfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
