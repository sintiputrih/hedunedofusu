I went to the Comedy Store and asked to do a routine. I turned up at midnight and I was so excited, but the crowd was a bit rough and when I was introduced, as being from America they just booed and booed before I had even said my name.”</p><p>Fallon admitted that he was shaken up by the horrible start. However, things took a turn once he got into his routine. Suddenly, it became a memorable experience for all the right reasons.</p><p>“I just thought, ‘Oh my gosh.’ I was so nervous and was shaking, but it was one of the best gigs of my life and I almost got a standing ovation!’ he told Norton via video call.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/your-paragraph-text-2023-09-12t124911-370.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Martin Short Shaded Jimmy Fallon During Their Tonight Show Interview Without The Host Even Realizing That His Joke Might've Contained The Truth">Martin Short Shaded Jimmy Fallon During Their Tonight Show Interview Without The Host Even Realizing That His Joke Might've Contained The Truth</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Martin Short's roast of Jimmy Fallon might've had some truth to it.</p><p>It was quite the turn of events for Fallon on the night.

Fallon admitted that he caught the bug for stand-up following his impromptu set with Chris Rock.</p><p>“I felt like the comedy gods were just telling me, you know, ‘Yeah, you should do stand-up again. So Chris Rock gets up, surprises the audience and destroys. He’s unbelievable. And so I went up to give him a bottle of water as a goof, and everybody started clapping, and he took the microphone and he [handed it out to me],” Fallon continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was like, wow. So I did stand-up for the first time last night in 10 years. It was unbelievable. I totally remembered it, it was super fun. It was great. I was like, I didn’t even know what I was talking about, he just made me so comfortable up there.”</p><p>Fallon had a great experience, and missed the sound of a hot crowd during a set.</p><p>After it was done with, Fallon was very thankful to Chris Rock.</p><p>"I got the bug and I wanted to thank Chris, thanks Mike, thank you Comedy Cellar,” he said. “I’ll work on an act, I’m going to work on an act and I’ll be out there, because I want to go out around the country, I want to say hi to everybody, all the fans because I love meeting people. I think it’s going to be fun, I’ll do it. So it’s Halloween, give me a couple month, I’ll work on something.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar46499576.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Comedian Lisa Lampanelli Completely Lost It After She Was Offered Money To Get Off The Stage During Her Standup Act">Comedian Lisa Lampanelli Completely Lost It After She Was Offered Money To Get Off The Stage During Her Standup Act</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After being heckled during her act, Lisa Lampanelli went off on the entire audience.</p><p>A great moment for Fallon, and fans are happy to hear about his return.

However, <a href=#>Chappelle had the perfect reaction to getting booed off the stage</a>. The moment took place early in Chappelle's career, and he realized that, despite the booing, he was still perfectly fine and not bothered at all. This gave the comedian thicker skin, knowing that even if he messed up, hearing the boos wasn't the end of the world.</p><p>Chappelle also got booed in front of an audience in Detroit for being out of it. Chappelle did agree that it wasn't his best set, though he said that the story was overblown.</p><p>"If you saw it, I wasn't drunk. I had smoked some reefer with some rappers," Chappelle said of the performance with MLive. "I don't know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong. Stronger than I was accustomed to."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continues, "The article goes on to say I was booed off stage, which is also incorrect," Chappelle said. "I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb."</p><p>That's right, even the best fall down sometimes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqnrculpqerXajBorrDZqypZZGYwW7A1Kulnpxdnru1u4yaZKehl53Brq3RnmSanqSav260xGaumqtdl7ywscNmm66qmaO0brTIrGSipqSnvHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
