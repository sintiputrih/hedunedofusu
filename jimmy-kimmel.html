There are kids in high school, and this guy’s a baseball player, this guy’s on the wrestling team, this guy is really smart.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“It’s funny how all of this has worked out – I wasn’t popular in high school, but now every drunken guy in the United States wants to be my pal. They all want to buy me a shot, and pretty soon I’m throwing up.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Here’s what I don’t understand about rioting. If you’re going to destroy a city for no reason, why destroy your own city? Move one city over.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“The number of households that own a television set is down for the first time since they started the survey. This is America! The only excuse for not having a TV in your home is, you’re too fat to fit into Best Buy to get one.”&nbsp;<strong>– Jimmy Kimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Did you have trouble at the airport this week? I had to throw away all my make-up. They said it’s because of this terrorist plot they foiled over in England. I believe it’s an elaborate ruse perpetrated by the big cosmetics industry.

Maybe it’s Maybelline.”&nbsp;<strong>– JimmyKimmel&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3><strong>How much is Jimmy Kimmel worth?</strong></h3><p>Jimmy Kimmel’s net worth is estimated to be $50 Million.</p><h3><strong>How old is Jimmy Kimmel?</strong></h3><p>He was born on November 13, 1967, and is currently 55 years old.</p><h3><strong>How tall is Jimmy Kimmel?</strong></h3><p>His height is 1.85 m, which is equal to 6 ft 1 in.</p><h2><span id=summary class=ez-toc-section></span><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Jimmy Kimmel is one of the wealthiest and most successful American talk show hosts.</p><p>His show is one of the longest-running late-night talk shows in the History of ABC network, breaking all records of other talk shows.</p><p>As of December 2022, Jimmy Kimmel’s net worth is‎ $50 Million.</p><h2>Jimmy Kimmel’s Bio, Wiki and Facts</h2><table style=width:71.5257%;height:792px><tbody><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Celebrated Name</th><td style=height:24px>Jimmy Kimmel</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Age</th><td style=height:24px>55 Years</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Nick Name</th><td style=height:24px>Jimmy</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Birth Name</th><td style=height:24px>James Christian Kimmel</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Birth Date</th><td style=height:24px>1967-11-13</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Gender</th><td style=height:24px>Male</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Profession</th><td style=height:24px>TV Host</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Father</th><td style=height:24px>James John Kimmel</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Mother</th><td style=height:24px>Joan Kimmel</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Place Of Birth</th><td style=height:24px>Brooklyn, New York City, United States</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Nationality</th><td style=height:24px>American</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Horoscope</th><td style=height:24px>Scorpio</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Siblings</th><td style=height:24px>a brother, Jonathan and a sister, Jill</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>Religion</th><td style=height:24px>Catholic</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=text-align:left;height:24px>School</th><td style=height:24px>Ed W.
