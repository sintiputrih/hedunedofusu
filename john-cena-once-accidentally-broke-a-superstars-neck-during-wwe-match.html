During his<a href=#> Café de Rene&nbsp;show</a>, Rene Dupree opened up about how John Cena broke a fellow wrestler’s neck.</p><p>Rene Dupree talked about a situation from 2004 where Jesús’ was kicked in the head by John Cena. ‘Jesús,’ Aguilera was showcased as the bodyguard of Carlito.</p><p>At the time, John Cena was the United States Champion, and he defended his title against Aaron Aguilera in a Street Fight at Armageddon ’04. While Aguilera reportedly entered the match with a few pre-existing injuries, his night was made worse when he injured his neck during the loss to John Cena.</p><p>Jesús! For those who don’t remember, he was Carlito’s bodyguard, and Cena broke his neck, actually. There was a spot where he kicked him in the head that legitimately broke his neck. I felt bad for him because, like, he broke his neck, he was out for like five or six months, and he was from San Diego.</p><p>Aaron Aguilera was fired from WWE in April 2005, and Rene Dupree revealed the incident that led to his dismissal. Aguilera reportedly arrived at a SmackDown taping in his hometown of San Diego, hoping to make his on-screen return.</p><p>According to Dupree, the Superstar made the mistake of dressing up in his full gear, which enraged Vince McMahon. That night, the former WWE CEO allegedly fired Aguilera. Of course, John Cena’s story continued, and it’s pretty hard not to see him to this day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you make of this situation?
