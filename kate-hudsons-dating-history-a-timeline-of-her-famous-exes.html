No moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter.”</p><p>She continued: “So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it’s been truly incredible.! ❤️Happy first date anniversary baby. #LoveThisMan 🙏 #WhatAYear.”</p><p>In October 2018, Hudson gave birth to the pair’s first child together, <a href=#>a daughter named Rani Rose.</a></p><p>“She’s here 💕,” the Something Borrowed star wrote on Instagram at the time. “We have decided to name our daughter Rani (pronounced Ronnie) after her grandfather, Ron Fujikawa. Ron was the most special man who we all miss dearly. To name her after him is an honor. Everyone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.”</p><p>An insider told Us Weekly at the time that Hudson<a href=#> “had the baby itch and wanted a girl more than anything.”</a></p><p>“She just knew that she wanted a baby with him and hoped and prayed that it would happen,” the insider said. “For it to be a girl is just the icing on the cake. Danny is so good with kids and has been great with her boys.”</p><p>Hudson previously welcomed son Ryder with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Chris Robinson</strong></a> and son Bingham with ex-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Matt Bellamy</strong></a>.
