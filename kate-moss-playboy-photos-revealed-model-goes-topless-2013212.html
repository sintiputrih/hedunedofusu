The highly-anticipated Playboy 60th anniversary issue, featuring world-famous supermodel Kate Moss on its cover, is out — and in it, she strips down and reveals the hot body that catapulted her into the arena of ’90s icons.
On the cover, Moss, 39, wears a skintight black leotard, Saint Laurent pumps and a fluffy, white snowball of a tail as she is tastefully shot from the backside. Her toned physique is accentuated as she stretches to her left with her arms elegantly cuffed, as the super gives a smoldering stare over her shoulder."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her toned physique is accentuated as she stretches to her left with her arms elegantly cuffed, as the super gives a smoldering stare over her shoulder. The 18-page&nbsp;<a href=#>editorial</a>, which was shot by fashion photographers<strong>&nbsp;Mert Alas</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Marcus Piggott</strong>, includes several topless images of Moss — as well as a full-frontal nude shot.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=598 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kate moss playboy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In one, the married mother of one wears nothing but two flashy pieces of jewelry, as she drapes her right hand across her chest. Another shot includes the model, topless, in a pair of retro black bunny ears, staring into the camera lens with her sultry cat eyes peeking out from behind a face mask.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=604 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kate moss playboy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>This is not the first time the face of Burberry and Rimmel has stripped down during her 25-year modeling career. Moss recently posed naked for Versace’s Vunk fall 2013 collection ad campaign, hiding her slim figure behind several strategically-placed bags. As <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> previously <a href=#>reported</a>, she also stripped down in May 2013 to promote St. Tropez self-tanning products. However, this does not mean <strong>Jamie Hince</strong>‘s wife is comfortable flaunting her naked figure. “I never felt comfortable about it,” she told Vanity Fair back in December 2012 of her nudity in previous spreads. “I hated my boobs! Because I was flat-chested. And I had a big mole on one,” she said.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=628 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kate moss playboy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nude or not, the world-famous model discussed with Playboy how different her life would have been had she not been discovered back in the ’80s. “I was, like, a child when I started. I was 14,” she said. “If it hadn’t happened, I don’t know what would have happened to me. I would be in Croyden [the neighborhood south of London where she grew up], working in a bar, probably.” She added, “As soon as I was given a chance I took it.”</p><p>Other supermodels who have previously bared all for Playboy include other ’90s icons like <strong>Claudia Schiffer</strong> in 1997 and <strong><a href=#>Naomi Campbell</a></strong> in 1999. The January/February 2014 double issue featuring Moss hits stands on Friday, Dec. 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGakmaSaeq670qxkqaSRrq%2BwxYypn6isn6h6s7HVnpilnZRiurCwxKVkoKeVqHq1u8%2BlnKyrXWd9cn%2BRamlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
