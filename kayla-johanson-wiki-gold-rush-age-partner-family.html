She even introduces herself as a “Gold Diggin’ B—h” on her Instagram bio.</p><p>She got this knack for gold from her grandfather who panned for gold in Arizona. Kayla, meanwhile, decided to take her talents to South Centra Alaska, where for the past two years, she has been running her dredge.</p><p>Speaking of how she found herself on Gold Rush, it was the franchise’s heartthrob Justin Hurt who called her up and asked if she wanted to join the team.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kayla, who has known Dustin for years was a little bit hesitant about joining the TV program. While certainly excited about the new opportunity, she pointed out to Dustin that they do the mining a little differently than she normally does hers. She was more like, “I’m a little nervous just to see if I fit in with everyone”.</p><p>Besides, the extra layer of work the team did not normally have to deal with gave Kayla this good opportunity to be a part of the spin-off Gold Rush series.</p><p>Outside of gold mining, Kayla is also busy finding goods and creating custom wire wrapped gold and gemstone jewelry for her Etsy shop where she sells her jewelry. The shop is called The Peeking Doe. However, the shop seemed temporarily closed, likely because she was off filming Gold Rush: White Water.</p><p>The custom jewelry creator previously worked at House of Health – Herbs, Vitamins, & Essential Oils, Former, Gander RV, and Hobby Lobby.</p><p>Meanwhile, for her studies, she went to Green Valley High School, Polaris High School, Foothill High School, and also studied at Montgomery Community College from 2007 – 2008.</p><p>Anyway, the new episodes from Gold Rush: White Water airs Fridays at 9 p.m. EST on Discovery.</p><p>As you may see the stakes are much higher this season with Fred’s sudden change in plans. What’s more, Dustin for the first time in the show’s history will be responsible for eight lives that include Kayla. However, while he can double his chances of discovering more gold, he also increases his chances of getting injured, or worse. Hopefully, Kayla, Dustin, and all will meet their goals.</p><h3><strong>Kayla Johanson Age</strong></h3><p>When the viewers saw her for the first time on Gold Rush, i.e, before Nov. 2021, Kayla Johanson had turned 32 years old.</p><h3><strong>Is Kayla Johanson On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes.
