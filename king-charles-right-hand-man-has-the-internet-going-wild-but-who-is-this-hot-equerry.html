In the video, which was posted a couple of days after the death of Queen Elizabeth, we see him entering Buckingham Palace. Obviously a few people had noticed him before that, but this is when he really started to get noticed. The video says that he is King Charles‚Äô new equerry, and people pretty much came away with two questions: Who is this guy? And what is an equerry?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@uktravel href=#>@uktravel</a><p>I saw ‚ÄúMajor eye candy‚Äù <a title=major href=#>#major</a> <a title=royalfamily href=#>#royalfamily</a> <a title=theking href=#>#theking</a> <a title=fypage href=#>#fypage</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ som original - Gui" href=#>‚ô¨ som original ‚Äì Gui</a></figure><h2 id=h-who-is-the-hot-equerry data-injectable=false>Who is the ‚Äúhot equerry?‚Äù</h2><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>The hot equerry, AKA Major Eye Candy, AKA Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Thompson, is the King‚Äôs right hand man. Since he took the role back in September 2022, Thompson has frequently been spotted by the King‚Äôs side at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">major events such as the coronation</a>, as well as accompanying the King and Queen on visits abroad.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, Thompson is 40 years of age, and is a member of the fifth Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland. Back in 2018, he escorted Queen Elizabeth around Balmoral Castle, and has since risen through the ranks, being promoted to Super Equerry upon Charles‚Äô accession to the throne.</p><h2 id=h-where-is-he-now data-injectable=false>Where is he now?</h2><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Lieutenant Colonel Thompson found himself under a lot of scrutiny from the general public. Details regarding his personal life, including whether or not he is single (he‚Äôs not), or who he‚Äôs dating, ended up prompting him to change his role. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>, last week Thompson shifted to ‚Äúa more executive less public-facing role.‚Äù He will still remain the senior equerry to King Charles and Queen Camilla, however.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>To be fair, the public attention he was getting was ridiculous. There were even TikToks claiming he should be the new James Bond.

Most royals have one ‚Äî and for some reason, they‚Äôre all hot. People began paying attention to other officers, such as Prince William‚Äôs equerry, Commander Rob Dixon, and Queen Camilla‚Äôs, Major Ollie Plunket. I‚Äôm not sure whether being hot is a requirement for the role or not, but people are definitely noticing a pattern; or maybe it‚Äôs just something to do with men in uniform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8qipaBlk52us7jErGSroZedwW60wKebZqWRo3qprdJmq6GdXZ67tbHRp5ytZZektq%2BzjLCgpZxdl8K1edahpmaho2LBqbXSZp%2BorF2avrax0auwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
