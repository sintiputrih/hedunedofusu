Before the year was out, he covered&nbsp;</span><span>Cold Water</span><span>&nbsp;(Major Lazer and Justin Bieber),&nbsp;</span><span>Self-Control</span><span>&nbsp;(Frank Ocean) and&nbsp;</span><span>Beamer Boy</span><span>&nbsp;(Lil Peep).&nbsp;The same year, he sang and produced the single&nbsp;</span><span>18</span></p><p><span>Landon Cube then took off with his May 2017 single&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>.&nbsp;He wasted no time in releasing other singles like&nbsp;</span><span>19, Legend</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Mad of the New World</span><span>&nbsp;which followed the same year.&nbsp;Landon’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Driving My Car</span><span>&nbsp;appeared in January 2018 and the same year he contributed to Louis Luv’s song&nbsp;</span><span>Quel est le Luv</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Driving My Car</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>&nbsp;leading in the most watched video stakes on its Youtube channel.&nbsp;Along with Lil Skies, he was featured in&nbsp;</span><span>No Jumper</span><span>&nbsp;– a September 2016 podcast by Adam22.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is Landon Cube net worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s still early days for the young talent, but he’s slowly making his mark in the competitive world of music.&nbsp;His salary is not yet known but his wealth has been estimated at $125,000 by some sources.&nbsp;With more musical efforts, the amount may soon become an insignificant figure for the artist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Landon Cube stands at a height of 5 feet 8 inches and sports a slim build.&nbsp;Details on his other measurements are not available at this time.&nbsp;However, the American musician has light brown hair and light brown eyes as distinguishing physical characteristics.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikkaOxsLqMnKybnV2XtrB5wKCcZq%2BZoLZutMSinqGsXaOytXnMrqqim18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
