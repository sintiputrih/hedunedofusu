George, the second patient, on the other hand, says that after a procedure known as a “Mommy Makeover,” which entails a stomach tuck, breast lift, liposuction, and augmentation, the “doctor left her with disfiguring scarring and different breast sizes.”</p><p>The former patient acknowledged that before the procedure, she had to sign a nondisclosure agreement that prohibited her from posting a critical evaluation of Hochstein or any of his staff members.</p><p>The agreement stated that the patient must pay $25,000 for every unfavorable remark. George, however, signed the paper under the mistaken impression that it was common for plastic surgeons in general.</p><p>However, there are a lot of questions concerning the use of nondisparagement to manage reputation in the plastic surgery sector because of a Florida civil lawsuit involving Dr. Leonard and two of his patients.</p><p>American cosmetic surgeon “Boob God,” who is 52 years old, is well-known for his work in breast augmentation and implants for women of all ages.</p><p>In addition, the doctor has years of experience in the industry and works with several well-known models, porn stars, and celebrities.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4226,"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Businessman</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Plastic Surgeon</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Monique Miles</a></h3>Monique Miles- Biography Monique Miles is an American lawyer, businesswoman, civil rights activist, Youth Mentor, social media celebrity, and media personality.
