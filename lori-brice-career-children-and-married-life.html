As of 2022, Lori Brice’s net worth was estimated to be approximately $1.5 million.</p><p>However, Ron White, her ex-husband, is incredibly wealthy—his net worth is $40 million.</p><h2><span id=Lori_Brice_Who_Is_She>Lori Brice: Who Is She?</span></h2><p>American comedian Ron White’s first wife is Lori Brice. Although the specifics of her birth are unknown, she was born in the United States in 1962.</p><p>She spent a significant portion of her youth with her parents and enjoyed a respectable upbringing. Brice has kept all the information private from the public out of respect for her parents’ right to privacy.</p><p>Lori was raised in a typical middle-class home, has no media connections, and only became well-known after her marriage to comedian White.</p><p>On August 1, 1981, they tied the knot in Caldwell County, Texas. Although at first it appeared like everything was going well between the two, their relationship quickly soured. In 1993, Lori filed for divorce from Ron after more than ten years of marriage, alleging irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Following her split from Ron, Lori has been living a solitary life.</p><h2><span id=Kids>Kids</span></h2><p>The sixty-year-old Marshall White, a son born in 1991, is Lori’s child. He will be thirty-one in 2022, and he is doing fairly well in life. Ron also has a close relationship with his only child. During an interview, he exclaimed with pride for his son,</p><p>It’s incredible because I had a difficult time raising him, and he’s brilliant, kind, and gifted. He keeps me safe.</p><p>Regretfully, Ron and Lori haven’t shared a lot of information about their child.</p><h2><span id=The_Ex-Husband_of_Lori_Brice_is_Married_Three_Times>The Ex-Husband of Lori Brice is Married Three Times</span></h2><p>Following a regrettable divorce, Ron, Brice’s ex-husband, wed Barbara Dobbs a second time. In 2004, White and Dobbs exchanged vows. Similar to his initial marriage, theirs got off to a respectable start. The two lived in their stunning Atlanta house for about four years.</p><p>However, destiny had it that in 2008, Ron and his second wife Dobbs separated once more. They remained mum about the precise cause of their breakup.</p><p>Margo Rey, a singer-songwriter, was his third wife. They got married in 2013 and got divorced in 2017, much like all of his previous partnerships.</p><p>He even recently, in 2020, filed a lawsuit to stop paying Margo the $25,000 in spousal support.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Ron_White_the_Ex-Husband_of_Lori_Brice>Who Is Ron White, the Ex-Husband of Lori Brice?</span></h2><p>Ron is not only a successful comedian but also an author, as we have previously reported. Ron was born in Fritch, Texas, on December 18, 1956, and made his comedy debut with his solo album Tater Salad a.k.a. 1990 saw the bust in Des Moines.</p><p>Throughout his career, he has put out several live CDs, including Behavioral Problems (2009) (both DVD and CD), You Can’t Fix Stupid (2006) (both DVD and CD), and Drunk in Public (2003) (both CD). Additionally, he just published his solo performance, “If You Quit Listening, I’ll Shut Up,” on Netflix.</p><p>In addition, he wrote a book that was on the New York Times bestseller list and titled I Had the Right to Remain Silent, But I Didn’t Have the Ability.</p><h2><span id=Now_where_is_Lori_Brice>Now, where is Lori Brice?</span></h2><p>Brice has been a loner ever since she and White got divorced. She has stayed far from the photographers and hasn’t made any public appearances.</p><p>It’s unclear if she got remarried after her split. Additionally, she is not active on any social networking sites, including Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. In any case, we hope she is living a quiet and lovely life apart from the spotlight.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Selim Bayraktar | Wife Bihter Bayraktar?
