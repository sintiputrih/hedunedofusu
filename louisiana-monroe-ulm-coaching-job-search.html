It was the first place the 67-year-old Bowden didn’t turn around as he’d done at so many other stops in his career, highlighting the difficulties of the situation.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>How good is the ULM job? What names could get in the mix? Here are the factors to keep in mind.</p><h2><strong>There’s almost no history of winning at the FBS level</strong></h2><p>Since moving up to the FBS in 1994, the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=272 href=#>Warhawks</a> have just one winning season and one bowl appearance, in 2012. They won a Sun Belt championship in 2005, but their 5-2 conference record was part of a 5-6 overall record.</p><p>Before the move, ULM was a successful program, winning the 1987 FCS/I-AA national championship and Southland Conference championships in 1990 and ’92, plus another playoff appearance in 1993. The topic of going back to the FCS level has come up in the community over the years, but it’s not clear how real the possibility is.</p><p>This is one of the toughest jobs out there, and it’s even harder now in the new Sun Belt with the additions of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1197 href=#>James Madison</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=211 href=#>Southern Miss</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=204 href=#>Old Dominion</a> and Marshall. The Sun Belt is sending 12 teams to bowls this year. ULM is one of the two that didn’t get there.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>We rank the open CFB coaching jobs, plus: Texas A&M expected to hire Duke's Mike Elko</p></a><h2><strong>There’s not much money, but it’s the focus for the new AD</strong></h2><p>Bowden’s $435,000 salary was the lowest publicly available salary of any FBS head coach. That’s lower than many Power 5 assistant jobs. It’s not the kind of salary pool that will attract a large group of candidates from the P5.</p><p>The football program finally began cost-of-attendance payments in 2021, a benefit that was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">first permitted in 2015</a>. NIL is not much of a factor here, and Bowden continually struggled to keep talented players on the roster because of it.</p><p>The program opened an end zone facility in 2016. That was its first new athletics facility since 1983.</p><p>But new athletic director John Hartwell, hired earlier this year, is known as a good fundraiser, and it was one of his top priorities upon getting the job.</p><h2><strong>So what names could get in the mix?</strong></h2><p>Based on conversations with industry sources, here are some names to keep an eye on.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Former New Mexico offensive coordinator Bryant Vincent</strong> went 7-6 as <a class=ath_autolink data-id=646 href=#>UAB</a>’s interim coach in 2022 and had internal support for the job there. At New Mexico, he improved the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=231 href=#>Lobos’</a> scoring by more than 16 points per game after inheriting the second-worst group in the FBS. The Kentucky native spent more than a decade as an Alabama high school coach and worked at UAB and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=276 href=#>South Alabama</a>, running the offenses.</p><p><strong>Tulane offensive coordinator Slade Nagle</strong> has been on staff for eight years and called plays for the last two seasons during the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=159 href=#>Green Wave</a>’s 23-3 run, and they’ll play for a second consecutive AAC championship this weekend. The Lake Charles native also coached at <a class=ath_autolink data-id=267 href=#>LSU</a> and played at McNeese.</p><p><strong>Nicholls head coach Tim Rebowe</strong> is 53-48 at the Louisiana school, including an FCS playoff appearance this year. The 60-year-old was a ULM assistant from 2001 to ’03 and has spent his entire career in the state.</p><p><strong>Florida associate head coach of offense Jabbar Juluke</strong> is as connected to the state of Louisiana as anyone, as a longtime high school coach in the state. He has also coached at LSU, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=214 href=#>Louisiana Tech</a> and Louisiana, where he worked under Billy Napier, developed several all-conference running backs and won a Sun Belt championship before following Napier to Florida.</p><p><strong>South Alabama offensive coordinator Major Applewhite</strong> is a Baton Rouge native who is deeply connected in Texas as a former <a class=ath_autolink data-id=182 href=#>Longhorns</a> player and assistant. Applewhite’s 15-10 record in two seasons as head coach at Houston was better than his successor on aggregate. In three seasons at South Alabama, he turned an offense that ranked 112th in scoring when he got there to a top-50 unit in each of the last two years, including the offense of a 10-win team last season.</p><p><strong>Florida A&M head coach Willie Simmons</strong> is 43-13 in five seasons at the Tallahassee school after taking over a program coming off six consecutive losing seasons. His 2021 team became the first HBCU to play in the FCS playoffs since 2016, and this year’s team is 10-1 and playing for the SWAC championship. He has had a lot of success at a school without many resources.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><b data-stringify-type=bold><a class=ath_autolink data-id=210 href=#>UTSA</a> running backs coach Julian Griffin</b> played wide receiver at ULM from 2008 to ’12, including on the program’s only bowl team. He also worked there as a graduate assistant in 2015. At UTSA, Griffin helped develop <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ia8p5gH6l4HMqOQq href=#>Sincere McCormick</a> into the best running back in school history and a two-time Conference USA player of the year. The Roadrunners are 31-11 over the last two years. Griffin knows ULM and what wins there.</p><p><strong>LSU quarterbacks coach Joe Sloan</strong> was a finalist the last time this job opened. He spent 2013 to ’21 at Louisiana Tech. But with LSU quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=HIl3T1vkm2PEeVYS href=#>Jayden Daniels</a> ticketed to be a Heisman Trophy finalist, Sloan might be able to hold out for better jobs.</p><p><strong>Former <a class=ath_autolink data-id=161 href=#>Houston</a> defensive coordinator Doug Belk </strong>was considered a rising star not long ago. He spent the past five years at Houston and also worked as a graduate assistant from Alabama from 2014 to l16.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=186 href=#>Oklahoma State</a> quarterbacks coach Tim Rattay</strong> played at Louisiana Tech and coached at the school from 2013 to ’18. He has done a great job with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Lz5D20obZj9rFwzQ href=#>Alan Bowman</a> this season as the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=234 href=#>Cowboys</a> knocked off <a class=ath_autolink data-id=178 href=#>Oklahoma</a> and will play for the Big 12 championship next Saturday.</p><p>(Photo: Petre Thomas / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGlwaW9jbnxzfJFsZmppX2eDcLjOrqCsoZGjrm65zqepqJ1dqrmuecKomJygmaO0brbOm2SsnZGnsKl7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
