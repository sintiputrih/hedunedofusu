Easily one of the most remarkable things about Hudson's personal life is the nature of her relationship with Evans since she is the wife of the famous actor's ex-fiancé.</p><h2 id=inside-kate-hudson-39-s-relationship-history>Inside Kate Hudson's Relationship History</h2><p>In the years since Kate Hudson rose to fame, the press has paid a lot of attention to her personal life. In some cases, that has taken the form of conjecture about <a href=#>Hudson's relationship with her fellow stars like Nick Jonas</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kate-hudson-and-danny-fujikawa-looking-very-happy-together.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There has also been a lot of attention paid to Hudson's love life over the years. Since 2017, much of that attention has been focused on Kate Hudson and Danny Fujikawa since they are currently engaged, and they have a daughter named Rani together.</p><p>Before Hudson got involved with her current man, she was married to the singer Chris Robinson from the year 2000 until 2007. Hudson also had her first child during her marriage to Robinson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey And Kate Hudson Were Cast In How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days In The Most 'Hollywood' Way Ever</a></span></p><p>On top of Hudson's ex-husband and current fiancé, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has been linked to several other stars in the past</a>. For example, before the start of the 2010s, Hudson reportedly dated Matt LeBlanc, Owen Wilson, Dax Shepard, Lance Armstrong, and Alex Rodriguez.</p><p>On top of Hudson's relationships that seem to be confirmed, there have also been rumors about her involvement with other stars. Hudson's rumored relationships have been with celebrities like Heath Ledger, Derek Hough, Diplo, and Brad Pitt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-kate-hudson-get-along-with-elle-evans>Does Kate Hudson Get Along With Elle Evans?</h2><p>In April 2010, Kate Hudson attended the Coachella Music Festival likely thinking that she was going to have a great time. Little did Hudson know that going to Coachella would change her life forever since she met Muse's frontman Matt Bellamy at the Festival.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kate-hudson-with-matt-bellamy-when-they-were-a-couple.jpg><p>After Hudson and Bellamy met, it didn't take long for the two stars to become a couple and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for her to become pregnant</a> as she explained to Elle in 2013. "It was all very old-fashioned and proper, and we went on lovely dates. And two months later I was pregnant … Well, yes [I was shocked], but I also thought, 'This is going to be interesting.' "</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2011, Bellamy and Hudson got engaged and their son Bingham was born months later in July. Before the couple walked down the aisle, they announced that they had broken up in December 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-bellamy-with-his-ex-fiancee-kate-hudson-and-with-his-wife-elle-evans-bellamy.jpg><p>Most importantly, Hudson and Bellamy also announced that they intended to remain close as they co-parent. "Kate and Matt have been separated for some time now. Despite this, they remain very close friends and committed co-parents."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kate Hudson's Nepo Baby Criticism As Goldie Hawn's Daughter Might've Caused Her To Switch Up Her Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A couple of months after Hudson and Bellamy announced their romantic relationship was over, he moved on. In February 2015, Bellamy got involved with the model Elle Evans who notably appeared in the music video for "Blurred Lines".</p><p>Almost three years after their relationship began, it was announced that Bellamy and Evans had gotten engaged in December 2017. In August 2019, Bellamy and Evans were wed, and she legally changed her name to Elle Evans Bellamy while still going by her original name professionally.</p><p>After Evans and Bellamy revealed they were expecting in February 2020, their daughter was born in June of that year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-bellamy-and-elle-evans-bellamy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Matt Bellamy has a son with Hudson and a daughter with Evans, the three stars are always going to be part of each other's lives. Of course, that is far from a unique situation as lots of parents have to deal with the awkwardness of hanging out with their ex's new spouse at family events.</p><p>In April 2022, photos of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson, Evans, and Bellamy celebrating Easter</a> with their kids wound up on social media. In those images, all three adults seemed very comfortable spending time together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-bellamy-s-wife-elle-evans-has-an-unusual-relationship-with-his-ex-fiance-kate-hudson.jpg><p>In addition to spending holidays together, Hudson, Bellamy, and Evans can run into each other at industry events since they are all stars. In 2016, all three of them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attended the opening for Soho House Malibu</a> before Bellamy and Evans got married or had their daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kate Hudson Had An Awkward Encounter With A Reporter Who Thought She Won An Oscar</a></span></p><p>From all accounts, it seems very clear that Hudson, Evans, and Bellamy are very good at co-parenting and co-existing peacefully. It should go without saying that is a wonderful thing for the son Hudson and Bellamy had together and everyone else in their family.</p><p>Of course, even when exes can hang out with each other for their children, that doesn't necessarily mean they want to. Worse yet, there easily could be a lot of tension in Hudson's relationship with Evans due to jealousy. The same holds true for Bellamy and Hudson's fiancé Danny Fujikawa since the two men could be jealous of each other too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kate-hudson-and-elle-evans-bellamy-holding-their-kids.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, it appears that not only are Hudson and Evans capable of hanging out, they actually enjoy being together when they don’t have to. After all, it seems very clear that in June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson and Evans went out</a> just the two of them to have fun according to a People article.</p><p>"The Glass Onion star, 44, and model Elle Evans, 33, stepped out Thursday at the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant after attending a gala performance of Cabaret At The Kit Kat Club in London’s West End. The stylish pair looked the best of friends as they held hands while strolling together along a London sidewalk,"</p><p>People's article revealed that the morning after their night out, Hudson shared an Instagram story about being in a great mood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYq%2BmuMuapLKrXay2p7GMnqOlnV2aw6K60mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllp57BqXnHoqpmnahis6qtzZycZqORqbJutNSdqqimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
