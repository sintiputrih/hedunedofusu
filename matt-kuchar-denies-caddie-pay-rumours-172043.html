It wasn't 10%, it wasn't $3,000. It's not a story."</p><p>His regular caddie, John Wood, was unable to attend the trip to Mexico due to Kuchar being a very late last-minute entrant to the tournament.</p><p>So the nine-time PGA Tour winner enlisted the help of local caddie, David Giral Ortiz, off of the recommendation of the Mayokoba tournament director.</p><p>Following the win, Kuchar praised his temporary caddie: "He was definitely my lucky charm. He brought me good luck and certainly some extra crowd support and did a great job as well. He did just what I was hoping for and was looking for."</p><p>Related: <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/tour-news/hosung-choi-receives-invite-pebble-beach-pro-172130 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/tour-news/hosung-choi-receives-invite-pebble-beach-pro-172130 data-before-rewrite-localise=/news/tour-news/hosung-choi-receives-invite-pebble-beach-pro-172130>Hosung Choi to make his PGA Tour debut next month</a></p><p>The 40-year-old netted nearly $1.3m for the win - caddies will normally receive 10% of the winnings - making $3,000 seem awfully short for the local knowledge that in no doubt helped contribute to his victory enormously.</p><p>A number of current and former PGA Tour professionals threw in their thoughts to the rumours. Australian Cameron Percy was one to add fuel to the fire, hinting that it could well be true with this tweet:</p><p>Though not every tweet was of a serious nature...</p><p>Kuchar closed with a four-under-par in his final round to finish four shots ahead of his nearest challenger Putnam. It moves him into second place in the FedEx Cup rankings.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm tickled, I'm thrilled to have won two events this early in the year," beamed Kuchar.</p><p>"To have won two out of three starts on the PGA Tour is mind boggling to me.</p><p>"Yeah, to set up the year, it absolutely sets up the year to be in great position for the FedExCup. There is a lot of the year left and a lot of great things that are out there to be done."</p><p>Expand <span class="accordion-title h4">Matt Kuchar What’s In The Bag?</span></p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=bookmark data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/matt-kuchar-whats-in-the-bag-138579 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/matt-kuchar-whats-in-the-bag-138579 data-before-rewrite-localise=/gear/gear-news/matt-kuchar-whats-in-the-bag-138579>Matt Kuchar What’s In The Bag?</a></strong></p><p>We take a look at the clubs inside…</p><p>Expand <span class="accordion-title h4">New Golf Rules 2019: All You Need To Know</span></p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=bookmark data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/new-golf-rules-2019-152161 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/news/new-golf-rules-2019-152161 data-before-rewrite-localise=/news/new-golf-rules-2019-152161>New Golf Rules 2019: All You Need To Know</a></strong></p><p>Golf's governing bodies new rules are in action…</p><p>Expand <span class="accordion-title h4">Tour Gear Round Up: Open Championship 2019</span></p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=bookmark data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/tour-gear-round-up-171151 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/gear/gear-news/tour-gear-round-up-171151 data-before-rewrite-localise=/gear/gear-news/tour-gear-round-up-171151>Tour Gear Round Up: Open Championship 2019</a></strong></p><p>Golf Monthly's weekly look at the equipment being…</p><p>Expand <span class="accordion-title h4">Clubhouse Podcast Ep 1: Is Rory Right To Call The European Tour A “Stepping Stone”?</span></p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-" data-bordeaux-image-check></figure><p><strong><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=bookmark data-original-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/golf-monthly-podcast/clubhouse-podcast-ep-1-rory-right-call-european-tour-stepping-stone-171640 data-url=https://www.golfmonthly.com/features/golf-monthly-podcast/clubhouse-podcast-ep-1-rory-right-call-european-tour-stepping-stone-171640 data-before-rewrite-localise=/features/golf-monthly-podcast/clubhouse-podcast-ep-1-rory-right-call-european-tour-stepping-stone-171640>Clubhouse Podcast Ep 1: Is Rory Right To Call The European Tour A “Stepping Stone”?</a></strong></p><p>The podcast is back for 2019!</p><p>For all the latest golf news, check the Golf Monthly website and follow our social media channels</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvLn6SopqSdubp6wqikaKaVrMBwwM6uqWamlazAcLnAratmo6WYtaK%2BjJ2cp6GVqHqkrcOdoJ5loJbGbr7UpqauqqNifnh%2Bj21q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
