The actor revealed in the book that was told that he “took phenobarbital (a barbiturate) during the second month of my life.”</p><p>“I want to be very clear on this point. I do NOT blame my parents for this,” he wrote. “Your child is crying all the time, clearly something is wrong, the doctor prescribes a drug, he’s not the only doctor who thinks it’s a good idea, you give the drug to the child, the child stops crying. It was a different time.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for more details about Matthew’s family:</p><h3>John Bennett Perry</h3><p>Matthew’s father was an actor who appeared in various TV shows and movies over the years, including <a href=#>The West Wing</a>, Paper Dolls, Family Law.
