He followed this up with seven wins in 2020, again ranking second in the NL.

Despite his commitment to the UCLA Bruins baseball team, Fried chose to sign with the Padres for $3 million.</p><p>He made his professional debut with the Arizona League Padres in 2012, spending the entire season there and posting a 0-1 record with a 3.57 ERA in 17.2 innings pitched. Fried played for the Fort Wayne TinCaps in 2013, where he recorded a 6-7 record with a 3.49 ERA in 23 starts.</p><p>His performance earned him recognition as the 43rd-best prospect in the minors by MLBPipeline by the end of the year. He was also named an MiLB.com Padres Organization All Star, with Baseball America ranking his curveball as the best in the Padres’ minor league system.</p><p>In 2014, Max Fried was ranked as the top pitching prospect and the second-best overall prospect in the Padres’ organization by MLB.com. Unfortunately, he spent most of the year injured and did not make his season debut until July. In August 2014, Fried underwent Tommy John surgery, causing him to miss the remainder of the 2014 season.</p><p>On December 19, 2014, Fried, along with Jace Peterson, Dustin Peterson, and Mallex Smith, was traded to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Justin Upton and Aaron Northcraft.</p><p>He made his return to action on April 9, 2016, with the Rome Braves and spent the entire 2016 season there, compiling an 8-7 record with a 3.93 ERA in 21 games (20 starts). Fried’s performance in the South Atlantic League earned him the recognition of being the 6th-best prospect, according to Baseball America.

Following the season, the Braves added Fried to their 40-man roster.</p><p>Max Fried received his first invitation to spring training at the beginning of the 2017 season.

Baseball America rated him as #3 on the AFL Hot Sheet. Braves manager Brian Snitker even considered Fried as a potential fifth starter for the team in 2018.</p><p>Fried’s 2018 season began with the AA Mississippi Braves but he soon moved to the Gwinnett Stripers after one game. He was called up to Atlanta in April. In 33.2 innings pitched for the Braves during the 2018 regular season, Fried achieved a 1-4 record with 44 strikeouts and a 2.94 ERA. Impressively, with runners in scoring position, he limited batters to just one hit in 30 at-bats (.033). When facing RISP with two outs, opposing batters were 0-for-14 with eight strikeouts.</p><p>In 2022, Fried was named an All-Star for the second consecutive year and earned a salary of $6.85 million through arbitration. During the season, he posted a 14-7 record with a 2.48 ERA, ranking third in the NL and 10th-lowest in Atlanta franchise history.</p><p>He also excelled in various pitching statistics, including the lowest percentage of hard-hit balls in the NL, the lowest barrel-percentage against, and being second in fewest walks per nine innings. He tied for fifth in highest LOB (left on base) percentage, showcasing his effectiveness on the mound. Fried’s curveball had the highest vertical movement among all NL pitchers, and he induced batters to swing at his pitches outside the strike zone at a high rate.</p><p>From 2019 to 2022, Fried boasted the lowest barrel-percentage against (4.6%) among all major league pitchers, and his 52 wins ranked second only to pitcher Gerrit Cole during that period. His defensive skills were also impressive, as opponents were wary of attempting stolen bases against him. Since his MLB debut in 2017, Fried recorded 23 pickoffs, leading all major league pitchers with a pickoff success rate of 14.29%, significantly higher than the MLB average of 1.6%.</p><p>Fried’s fielding abilities earned him the 2022 NL Gold Glove Award at the pitcher’s position, marking his third consecutive Gold Glove win. He became the first Braves pitcher since Greg Maddux to achieve this feat, joining a select group of pitchers in MLB history to win the award three times in a row.</p><p>Although he finished second in the voting for the 2022 NL Cy Young Award, Fried’s remarkable achievements in pitching and fielding continued to garner recognition. At the end of the 2022 season, he was selected to his third consecutive All-MLB team.</p><p>In 2023, Fried’s salary for the season was determined through the arbitration process, amounting to $13.5 million. He faced a brief stint on the 15-day injured list in April and May, initially for a strained left hamstring and later for a strained left forearm. On June 5, he was transferred to the 60-day injured list but made his comeback on August 4.</p><p>Fried’s pitching repertoire includes a four-seam fastball clocked at 94-96 mph, two variations of a 74 mph curveball, an 84 mph slider (since 2019), a 93 mph sinker, and an 84 mph change-up.
