Twitter user @MikeinPA1 tweeted a flashback Friday photo that shows Punk and James at a dark match prior to an episode of RAW in 2005. The two Superstars look relatively different then the counterparts we know today."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

James- who is currently employed by WWE on the RAW roster wonders how different her career would have been if she and Punk remained a pair as was planned by WWE during that dark match debut.<br><br>As we know, that never panned out. Punk had a successful run with WWE, but left the company years ago and filed a lawsuit against WWE’s doctor- which he famously won earlier this year. James was a multi-time Champion in WWE before leaving for Impact Wrestling. Now back, she is a core member of the women’s division.<br><strong>How different would Punk and James’ lives have been if WWE stuck to that plan? Does the pairing interest you for an on-screen role?
