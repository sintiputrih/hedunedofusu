Then in 2018, Morgan hired a social media team to promote clips of her act online. They <a href=#>went viral</a>, which changed the course of her life.</p><p>Now, Morgan is riding the success of her debut Netflix special, “Leanne Morgan: I’m Every Woman,” which became one of the highest-watched specials on the platform in 2023.</p><p>That led her on a cross-country stand-up tour — where she sold out arenas like the Chicago Theatre and the Knoxville Civic Coliseum in Tennessee — and notched a role alongside actors Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon in the forthcoming Amazon wedding comedy, “You’re Cordially Invited.”</p><p>The comedian’s meteoric and unconventional rise well into her fifth decade landed her a spot on the Forbes and Know Your Value “50 Over 50” U.S. list this year, which celebrates women who have shattered age and gender norms.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think I said, ‘What in the world?’” Morgan recently told “Morning Joe” reporter Daniela Pierre-Bravo at a luncheon honoring those women in New York City. “I’ve met all these women here who are in finance, and you can tell they paid attention in school, and see I didn’t, I was the class clown.”</p><p>But Morgan’s authentic and relatable sense of humor — poking fun at marriage, motherhood, menopause, even dating apps — has led to her runaway success.</p><p>“I did not realize what was going to happen to me at this point in my life and it’s a blessing,” she told Pierre-Bravo. “I think it was the best timing.”</p><p>For Morgan — who also plans to release a book next year — she hopes her roundabout path resonates with others. “Keep dreaming, keep going — it’s the best time,” she said. “It’s when you’re the wisest, it’s when you know your craft, you know your business — it could not be a better time.”</p><p>In fact, the theme of her stand-up tour centers on busting the biggest myth about career longevity after 50. “I think people think it’s over — and it’s not over!” Morgan explained. “I feel good, I’ve got grand-babies — I want to go and do, I want to see, I want to learn, it’s just beginning.”</p><p class=endmark>“My 100-city tour — the tour I’m on right now — it’s called the ‘Just Getting Started’ tour because I feel like I’m just getting started at 58 years old,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rr%2FNm5pnm5%2BifKy6zrBksqelp3q3rcuunGibkaeypr6MoKmor6SdfK6706Gcq6CfpLFuucSnpqmZpaiybrjEnWSlnZGju6Z5zKipoJmeYsC1rc2dZJ%2BZnZp6s6%2FNmmhrcWhufw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
