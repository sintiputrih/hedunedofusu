The kids get to watch a couple of cartoons in the morning just on the weekends. And so they're used to adventure and exploration," Jeremiah told us. "We've seen the benefits of going outside with our kids. Because being outside, it's the epicenter of connection, connection to your community, connection as a family, connection to adventure, connection to imagination."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent</p></figure><p>The <a href=#>HGTV stars</a> revealed that they love to go to local parks, have picnics with their kids, and even play a game (or two) of hopscotch.</p><p>Nate told us that finding outdoor activities that your kids are interested in is key to drawing them away from a screen.</p><p>"I mean, our son Oskar, who's four, is a little bit lazy. So he complains when we walk," Nate said. "But it's amazing those aches go away when he's playing red light green light on the sidewalks of New York City with us."</p><p>"You have to kind of go down to their level of what's fun and what's exciting," he added. "Sometimes it is just [a game of] red light green light or going to see a neighborhood with a building that [Oskar has] seen in his book of New York buildings."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nate Berkus (@nateberkus)</a></p></figure><p>Overall, Nate and Jeremiah agreed that parenting has helped them to rediscover joy in more mundane things. "Being outside and seeing the world through our children's eyes and exploring things and discovering things with them ... I'm more playful," Jeremiah said. "You know, Nate's really fun and goofy, but the kids are goofy on another level, and it makes us goofy."</p><p>He continued, "We were having dinner the other night, and we looked at each other. We're like, 'Wow, like, it just doesn't get better than this.'"</p><p>Cath new episodes of The Nate & Jeremiah Home Project on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo661sYybnKujpah6rLXDrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
