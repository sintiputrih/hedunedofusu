The quarterback is all business and seldom does he get involved in any kind of drama with his teammates or the public in general. However, this time his name is in the midst of drama, not for something that he did or said, but for something his wife said. <strong>Kelly Stafford</strong>, his wife, got into an argument with Blueface the rapper following the Rams-Steelers game on Sunday at SoFi Stadium.</p><p>While the Kelly-Blueface standoff is the most bizarre one, it originated after the wife of the NFL quarterback called the rapper out for having three female dancers take off their shorts and dance nearly butt-naked in front of millions at SoFi. Blueface had also posted this to his social media and as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dancers were twerking for him, he threw cash at them</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Stafford</a> was not having this. She called Blueface out on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Morning After</a> podcast. As a reply, Blueface called Matthew Stafford’s wife a ‘Karen’ which is a word used to describe hard-headed individuals that find reasons to complain and do not enjoy themselves nor allow others to enjoy themselves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-stafford-called-out-blueface-over-his-naked-dance-girls-at-sofi-stadium><strong>Kelly Stafford called out Blueface over his naked dance girls at SoFi Stadium</strong></h2><p>Blueface stood by his actions, claiming that he had done nothing wrong. Despite him posting his act on social media and doing it in person at SoFi, the rapper was not banned or warned, which meant that his actions were acceptable to the stadium officials. So why should it be an issue for Kelly Stafford?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Matthew-Stafford-and-Blueface.jpg><p>Blueface had this to say on X:</p><pre class=wp-block-verse>Matt, get your wife bro before I get disrespectful.

Kelly has every right to call out what she sees as inappropriate and Blueface did not like that, so he clapped back with a fair justification that his actions did not impact the outcome of the game in any manner.</p><p>However, he was out of pocket for calling Kelly Stafford a ‘Karen.’ Blueface has already given his word that he will be back at SoFi when the Rams play there next. Kelly described Blueface’s antics as “embarrassing” and “disappointing”. She made it clear that she will not be bringing her children along if such incidents are expected to occur frequently in the future.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBuvsCpp56qXZe5trHFmpqeZZSewLOx0qmcnKyjYrqiwNNmqq2Zlpu8s7DSZq6inpViuKa4y7Jkna2SmbyurcinlnBlmJq%2FbrfAq5ynZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
