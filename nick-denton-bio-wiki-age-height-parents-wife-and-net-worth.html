He co-wrote a book about the collapse of Barings Bank, the oldest merchant bank in London, called All That Glitters (1996).</p><p>He was a co-founder in 1998 of a social networking site, First Tuesday. That same year Denton co-founded media-monitoring service Moreover Technologies with David Galbraith and Angus Bankes, schoolmates from UCS. Shortly after, he moved to San Francisco in the United States, and in the summer of 2002, he moved to New York City.</p><p>Denton founded Gawker Media in 2002, initially running the company out of his apartment in New York City’s SoHo. Gawker Media initially had only two internet sites — Gawker (a news and gossip site) and Gizmodo (a gadgets and technology blog).</p><p>Gawker Media blogs expanded to include Jezebel (aimed at women), and Deadspin (a sports site), as well as Lifehacker (tips to live life better), Jalopnik (automotive culture), io9 (science, futurism, and science fiction), and Kotaku (video games and culture).</p><p>When asked about the exchange by a reporter for The Guardian, the reporter said Roubini then “reprises the rant, embellishing it with references to the KGB, Denton’s sexual orientation, and a sweary suggestion of what the man might do with himself, which he belatedly asks me not to quote…. the piece of art in question is described by Roubini as the work of a highly regarded feminist artist whom he won’t name and which doesn’t, he assures me, looks anything like a vulva.” Denton for his part commented: “How can such a brilliant economist, at the height of his reputation, be quite so clueless?”</p><p>On 28 October 2010, Denton published an anonymous kiss-and-tell piece entitled, “I Had a One-Night Stand with Christine O’Donnell”. However, according to the writer, O’Donnell only slept naked with the anonymous writer and did not have sex with him.</p><p>The National Organization for Women condemned the piece as “slut-shaming”. NOW’s president, Terry O’Neill, said, “It operates as public sexual harassment. And like all sexual harassment, it targets not only O’Donnell but all women contemplating stepping into the public sphere.” Salon’s Justin Elliott criticized the ad hominem nature of the article, tweeting “Today, we are all Christine O’Donnell.” Gawker.com reportedly paid in the “low four figures” for the story. Denton defended it, praising its “brilliant packaging.”[34]</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nick-denton-awards-accomplishments-and-achievements></span>Nick Denton Awards Accomplishments and Achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Founded Gawker Media in 2002, which quickly became a leading source of online news and gossip.</li><li>Helped pioneer the practice of “blogging” and created a new model for online journalism that emphasized transparency and immediacy.</li><li>Built a network of websites that attracted millions of readers and earned praise for their bold, irreverent reporting style.</li><li>Received several awards for his work in journalism, including the George Polk Award for his coverage of the Bill O’Reilly sexual harassment scandal.</li><li>Sold Gawker Media to Univision in 2016 for $135 million, after the company was forced into bankruptcy due to a lawsuit funded by billionaire Peter Thiel.</li><li>Continues to be involved in media and technology through his investments in various startups and his work as a consultant and advisor.</li><li>Advocated for free speech and press freedom throughout his career, even in the face of legal and financial challenges.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nick-denton-quotes></span>Nick Denton Quotes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“The internet has disrupted the traditional media landscape, but it has also created new opportunities for independent voices.” <span><i></i>Click to Tweet</span> “The internet has given a voice to people who were previously unheard, and that’s a good thing.” <span><i></i>Click to Tweet</span> “Good journalism is about holding the powerful accountable.” <span><i></i>Click to Tweet</span> “In a world of fake news and misinformation, it’s more important than ever to support quality journalism.” <span><i></i>Click to Tweet</span> “Journalism is not a popularity contest; it’s about telling the truth, even when it’s unpopular.” <span><i></i>Click to Tweet</span><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-nick-denton><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-nick-denton></span><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_XYZ_H2_and_Centered>Frequently Asked Questions About</span> Nick Denton <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Denton?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Nick Denton born Nicholas Guido Anthony Denton is a British Internet entrepreneur, journalist, and blogger.
