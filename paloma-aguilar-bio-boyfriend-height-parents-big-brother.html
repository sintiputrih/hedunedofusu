She also turned all the attention towards herself when she joined the alliance together dubbed “Girls’ Girls”.</p><p>Paloma commented about fellow contestant Taylor Hale saying, “My initial impression of Taylor is that she wants to use her beauty to allure men which is a strategy which is like so old”.

She’s just digging that hole for herself with the girls”.</p><p>Paloma was also communicating with this week’s HOH, Daniel Durston to put Taylor as a possible eviction choice. “She’s a question mark,” Paloma starts. “She’s one of the people that I didn’t connect with immediately,” Daniel admits. “I just don’t know if I can trust her,” Paloma adds.</p><p>“Taylor is just not part of the Girls’ Girls alliance and she’s spending so much time around the guys. I wouldn’t personally go for Taylor because if she somehow stays in the house, she’s gonna come for me…so of course, I want to persuade [Daniel] to help my game,” Paloma says in a talking head.</p><p>“Even though Daniel hasn’t nominated Taylor, seeing two guys on the block is wonderful for Paloma’s game because of numbers,” Paloma says after the nominee reveal. “The only thing I’m worried about is this backstage fiasco…you never know what’s in store.”</p><h3><strong>Does Paloma Aguilar Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Paloma Aguilar appears happily single.
