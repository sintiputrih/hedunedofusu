The group’s first album under its new name, entitled <i>The Grand Magnolias</i>, was released in 2011. The songs were written by McDonald and band member Jonathan Pears and produced by Dan Hannon and Ken Coomer. The album has seen a boost in sales since Paul McDonald’s appearance on <i>American Idol</i>, and it reached number twelve on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and had sold 9,000 copies by April 27, 2011. iTunes pulled the album from its store, without explanation, and the sales dropped off 60% from the previous week.

Thirteen competed in the finals.</p><p>Since entering the competition, McDonald has made use of the social networking site Twitter to communicate with his fans and promote his band, The Grand Magnolias. The album also debuted on the Billboard Heatseekers chart before McDonald even sang in the show’s semi-final round. He was also the first 2011 <i>Idol</i> hopeful to reach 50,000 followers on his newly created official <i>American Idol</i> Twitter account. McDonald continues to be one of the most popular <i>American Idol</i> Season 10 competitors on the social networking site.</p><p>McDonald was eliminated from the show on April 14, 2011, with a finish of 8th place.</p><h4>Performances and results</h4><table><tr><th>Episode</th><th>Theme</th><th>Song choice</th><th>Original artist</th><th>Order #</th><th>Result</th></tr><tbody><tr><td rowspan=2>Audition</td><td rowspan=2>Auditioner’s Choice</td><td>“Tutti Frutti”</td><td>Little Richard</td><td rowspan=2>N/A</td><td rowspan=2>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>“Maggie May”</td><td>Rod Stewart</td></tr><tr><td>Hollywood Round, Part 1</td><td>First Solo</td><td>N/A</td><td>Grace Potter and the Nocturnals</td><td>N/A</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Hollywood Round, Part 2</td><td>Group Performance</td><td>“Carry On Wayward Son”</td><td>Kansas</td><td>N/A</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Hollywood Round, Part 3</td><td>Second Solo</td><td>“Landslide”</td><td>Fleetwood Mac</td><td>N/A</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Las Vegas Round</td><td>Songs of The Beatles Group Performance</td><td>“Blackbird”</td><td>The Beatles</td><td>N/A</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Hollywood Round Final</td><td>Final Solo</td><td>“American Dreams”</td><td>The Grand Magnolias</td><td>N/A</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Top 24 (12 Men)</td><td>Personal Choice</td><td>“Maggie May”</td><td>Rod Stewart</td><td>10</td><td>Advanced</td></tr><tr><td>Top 13</td><td>Your Personal Idol</td><td>“Come Pick Me Up”</td><td>Ryan Adams</td><td>4</td><td>Safe</td></tr><tr><td>Top 12</td><td>Year You Were Born</td><td>“I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues”</td><td>Elton John</td><td>2</td><td>Safe</td></tr><tr><td>Top 11</td><td>Motown</td><td>“The Tracks of My Tears”</td><td>The Miracles</td><td>9</td><td>Safe</td></tr><tr><td>Top 11</td><td>Elton John</td><td>“Rocket Man”</td><td>Elton John</td><td>3</td><td>Bottom 3</td></tr><tr><td>Top 9</td><td>Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</td><td>“Folsom Prison Blues”</td><td>Johnny Cash</td><td>9</td><td>Safe</td></tr><tr><td>Top 8</td><td>Songs from the Movies</td><td>“Old Time Rock and Roll” — <i>Risky Business</i></td><td>Bob Seger</td><td>1</td><td>Eliminated</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=post-idol></span>Post-Idol<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>McDonald was one of the 11 performers in the 2011 <i>American Idols Live Tour</i>, which began in West Valley City, Utah, on July 6, 2011, and ended in Rochester, New York, on September 10, 2011.
