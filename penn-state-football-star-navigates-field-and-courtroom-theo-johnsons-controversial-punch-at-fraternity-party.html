As we’ve seen over the years, that spotlight can follow players off the field as well.
Earlier this year, we heard about an incident involving one of the star players, where a punch was thrown, and charges filed.
What really happened, and what was the follow up?
Number 84 for Penn State is Theo Johnson."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The chapter and its members have been providing as much support as possible to the injured member and we are grateful for their efforts."<p>According to the State College Police Department criminal complaint, the victim says Johnson punched him in the face after he questioned Johnson not having a wristband and Johnson refusing to leave the party.</p><p>But what sparked the punch by Johnson?</p><p>A Penn State Student Affairs office review mentions Johnson allegedly being spit on right before the punch. Immediately after the punch, it appears to be a rugby scrum, with others joining the scuffle, and Johnson backing up and eventually climbing over a fence to get away.</p><p>Some felt Johnson should have been charged with a felony, but the prosecutor in the case, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna disagreed telling 6 News, "after reviewing video tapes of the incidents, our office concluded that a reduction of the charges to simple assault by mutual combat more fairly reflected the incident in its entirety.”</p><p>Afterwards State College police body cam video shows the officer interview of the victim, who first says he doesn’t need to be hospitalized.</p><p>The victim is eventually hospitalized with a concussion. Here's an update on his condition from his attorney:</p>"He is still having significant issues with migraines. This is a particular problem when he has to focus (such as studying for exams) and when he is working on a computer."<p>Theo Johnson meanwhile continuing to play, hauling in two touchdown passes against UMass.</p><p>“So, you know it’s good to be more involved in the game plan and add more value,” said Johnson is a post-game interview. “I’m hoping to do just that.”</p><p>This past summer, Johnson was sentenced in Centre County court to six months of ARD (Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition) which will allow him to clear the charges from his record.</p><p>Penn State athletics issued a statement: "We are aware of the result of Theo Johnson’s case. These alleged actions do not reflect the values and standards of our programs and have been addressed.”</p><p>And Theo Johnson had another touchdown catch on Saturday in the game against Indiana. For the season he remains one of the Nittany Lions top receivers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfpbKvuoysq5qslWKzsLvTm5ilpF2owaK%2BjKeYr6GXlsGmv4yfoJ6klGKur7CMnKauqqSnvLC5jK2fnqddn7yputKopaxlk6S7tb7Or5yrq5mWuW681KeaoWWRqXqnvsCtnKummanGbrzAq6uy</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
