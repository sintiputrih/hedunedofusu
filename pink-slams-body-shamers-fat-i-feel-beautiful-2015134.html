After an onslaught of negativity surrounding her dress at a cancer benefit on Saturday, April 11, <strong><a href=#>Pink</a></strong> took to Twitter to address those criticizing her body.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can see that some of you are concerned about me from your comments about my weight," she <a href=#>began</a>. "You're referring to the pictures of me from last night's cancer benefit that I attended to support my dear friend Dr. Maggie DiNome. She was given the Duke Award for her tireless efforts and stellar contributions to the eradication of cancer. But unfortunately, my weight seems much more important to some of you."</p><p>The "Just Give Me a Reason" singer, 35, wore a black, ankle-length gown with a deep V-neck top to the ball.&nbsp;</p><p>"While I admit that that dress didn't photograph as well as it did in my kitchen, I will also admit that I felt very pretty," she <a href=#>continued</a>. "In fact, I feel beautiful. So, my good and concerned peoples, please don't worry about me. I'm not worried about me. And I'm not worried about you either:)… I am perfectly fine, perfectly happy, and my healthy, voluptuous and crazy strong body is having some much deserved time off. Thanks for your concern.
