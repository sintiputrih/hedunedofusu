Ginormo is a sci-fi comedy series satirizing Japanese monster movies and TV shows of the 1960s and 1970s. Using only effects from that time period - bad rubber monster suits, spaceships on strings, miniatures and hokey scripts and dialogue - Ginormo pays homage to a period of craftsmanship before CGI came onto the scene. Presented as a lost science fiction series from 1972 that was never aired because it was so bad, Ginormo lovingly and humorously pays tribute to a by-gone era in the form of a ridiculous meta comedy that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.</description></item><item><title>Kate Hudson reveals how daughter Rani is taking after grandma Goldie Hawn with hidden talent</title><link>/kate-hudson-rani-rose-takes-after-grandmother-goldie-hawn-hidden-talent.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/kate-hudson-rani-rose-takes-after-grandmother-goldie-hawn-hidden-talent.html</guid><description>The "Let's Talk About Love" singer shares her daughter with fianc√© Danny Fujikawa Kate Hudson's daughter Rani Rose is quickly growing up to become a star just like her legendary family members, and at just five years old, is really coming into her own.
