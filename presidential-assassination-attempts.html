Both, unusually, were perpetrated by women.</p><p>The first attempt on Ford’s life came on September 5th. As the president walked near the California Capitol building in Sacramento, a 26-year-old woman wearing a red robe slipped out of the crowd. Her name was <a href=# rel=noopener>Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme</a>, and she was a member of the infamous Manson Family.</p><p>Ford noticed the woman. In his testimony about the attempted assassination, <a href=# rel=noopener>he said</a> that Fromme “appeared to want to either shake hands or speak, or at least wanted to get closer to me.”</p><p>Instead, she raised a .45 caliber pistol and pulled the trigger. But much to her dismay, the gun did not fire.</p><p>“It didn’t go off!” <a href=# rel=noopener>Fromme wailed</a> as Secret Service agents tackled her. “It didn’t go off,” she continued. “Can you believe it? It didn’t go off.”</p><p>Fromme —&nbsp;who had allegedly wanted to kill Ford to make a statement about the environment — hadn’t loaded the chamber. And Ford, apparently unshaken, went to the California legislature to give a scheduled address.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-363261 alt="Squeaky Fromme" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/squeaky-fromme.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-363261 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Fromme was convicted of attempted murder. Years later, she left prison in 2009.</span></p><p>The second attempt on Ford’s life came 17 days later, on September 22nd. As the president left a conference at St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, a woman named Sarah Jane Moore raised a .38 caliber pistol and took aim.</p><p>Moore, who believed that killing the president would spark a revolution, nearly succeeded in murdering Ford. But as she fired, a Vietnam veteran named <a href=# rel=noopener>Oliver Sipple</a> noticed the gun and lunged at her, thwarting her plans.</p><p>“I’m not a hero, I’m a live coward,” Sipple later said. “It’s probably the scariest thing that ever happened in my whole life.”</p><p>Ford <a href=# rel=noopener>later described</a> both of his would-be assassins as “off her mind.” And though he “wore a protective vest for weeks” following the two presidential assassination attempts, he was still determined to be in public.</p><p>“[P]eople said to me, ‘Well, why don’t you stay in the White House and not go out to meet the public?'” Ford told Larry King in 2004.</p><p>“My answer to them was, a president has to be aggressive, has to meet the people, and therefore, I did. And… thank God I had no further incidents.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxvsSsoJ2dnqm2oriMmqqsmaOotq%2Bt06Kmp2WRqcGmuc%2Btqmhs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
