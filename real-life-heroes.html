Yes, that James Blunt.
In 1999, before the British pop star was famous for his melancholy tune “You’re Beautiful,” he was a lead officer in the British Army. In June of that year, Blunt prevented what some feel might have been the start of World War III when he ignored a direct order from a U.S. Army general — and risked being court-martialed in the process."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So they found and took over their own suitable base, an airport outside of Kosovo called the Pristina Airport.</p><p>Unfortunately, NATO had had the same plan. The Pristina Airport was a central location that would have offered NATO a better position for outreach and communication with the people of Pristina.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-201224 alt="James Blunt In Tank" width=634 height=410 data-sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/james-blunt-in-tank-e1545058388197.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-201224 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>DailyMail UK</span><span class=caption-body>Blunt on the Macedonia/Yugoslavian border in 1999.

He felt invading would cause undue tensions with the Russians and potentially undo all of the peacekeeping that had taken place since the Kosovo War ended just a few days prior.</p><p>When he was told to invade the airfield, he refused. The order had come from a U.S. Army general, and by refusing, Blunt was risking being court-martialed.</p><p>Thankfully, another general who was in Pristina agreed with Blunt and recognized the danger in invading as well. Within a few hours, he pulled all of the troops back, resolving the conflict peacefully.</p><p>After this look at some real-life heroes, check out <a href=#>this pigeon</a> that saved over 200 soldiers.
