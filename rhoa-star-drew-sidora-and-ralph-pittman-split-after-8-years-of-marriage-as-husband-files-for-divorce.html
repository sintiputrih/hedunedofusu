'RHOA' star has done it all to forget underpaid past</a></p><h2 class=split>Inside Drew Sidora and Ralph Pittman's relationship</h2><p>In August 2014, the 37-year-old actress married Pittman and in June 2015, the pair welcomed their son Machai and daughter Aniya in February 2018. From a previous relationship, Sidora also has another son, <a href=#>Josiah</a>, 11.</p><p>The couple's rocky relationship and issues were featured on RHOA. In 2022, the 'Step Up' actress found a suspicious text exchange between Pittman and his then-female assistant. On the show, Sidora said, "Finding out my husband was getting close with his assistant was really hard for me. I packed up my kids and we went to Chicago. I literally ran away from home," and has also said that she wanted him to "respect the relationship."</p><p>Listing their separation on Thursday, February 23, the paper's filed revealed that between the spouses "there is no chance or hope of reconciliation," according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Was Ralph Pittman accused of gaslighting Drew Sidora?</h2><p>Pittman, who faced accusations of gaslighting Sidora, was called "so disrespectful" by Kenya Moore as castmates of 'RHOA' also took the matters of their marital woes on the show. In a 2022 episode, Moore, 52, was seen talking to Pittman as he said, "You're basically saying that she's lying and how it happened was not how it happened. That would piss me the f--- off if somebody said that to me to my face, especially if I'm hurting. Do you not understand that? You're tearing her down."</p><p>In June 2022, the actress told <a href=# rel=nofollow>BET</a> that the couple planned to keep fighting for their marriage despite the challenges in their relationship. She said, "I thought it was like Cinderella like a happily ever after and so we thought that's what it was going to be," and added, "My parents who have been married for like 60 years made it look so easy. I'm in a situation where we have children, we're moving to a new city — life is happening and people are growing as well as changing."</p><p>Talking about the pair's effort to continue to fight for their relationship, Sidora said, "It's hard because sometimes you're like, do I need to stay in this marriage or am I better off by myself? Then I think to myself when two people commit and you keep committing to each other, what can we do to fix this? You're switching counselors to find the right one — but we're committed and I think that's what keeps people together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpikrm6%2F05qpZpyimsRuv8idpquZXZa7pXnRmqOpoF2ltrXAzJqlZqugoba1ecCfq56qXW16urHAq6pmp5ZiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dlsButNSsmZqmlGKzqrjErGSfp6JisarCzquang%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
