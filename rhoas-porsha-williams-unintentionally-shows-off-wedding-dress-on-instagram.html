During an Instagram live stream being watched by around 2,000 fans on November 9, Porsha's full wedding dress was revealed after it was visible in the background as she filmed with Lauren. The clip, which was <a href=#>reshared</a> across social media, showed Porsha modelling an outfit from her The Drop collection via Amazon, before she turned the cameras on Lauren who was having a little trouble with a crisscross top. But instead of just filming her sister, half the screen was actually filled with Porsha's stunning red ballgown wedding dress, and remained onscreen for several seconds before the reality star realized. "Ah! My wedding dress was in the thing! Take it down!" Porsha shouted as she moved the camera away. But it was a little too late for that.</p><p>As for why Porsha opted for a red gown for her big day?&nbsp;<a href=#>Holly Folly TV</a> reported red is a traditional color for a wedding dress in Nigeria, and the dress is made of Aso Oke to honor the Yoruba culture. The outlet claimed the "Real Housewives of Atlanta" star will pair the ensemble when she dons it for her and Simon&nbsp;Guobadia's big day with coral beads and gold jewelry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpbH50gI6rn6iZo2K9sL7SoZhmr5mhuaqtzKxkrqaZo8GmutOipqeZnKHGbr%2FHqK6sZZ%2Bbs27DxJ2boqaXYrGzsdKsZKimXZ67tMDAoKmapV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
