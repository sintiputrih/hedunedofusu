We’ll see, we’ll see,” Sonja told Us. “I thought the guy was local!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonja-Morgan-Still-Texts-Illinois-Man-She-Met-Filming-Crappie-Lake.jpg><p>Luann, for her part, developed an attraction to another Benton man, but she didn’t see many options for long-term relationships. “They’re all kind of married in these small towns,” she explained to Us. “There’s not a lot to do, so I understand why people would be married. You need a partner.”</p><p>Welcome to Crappie Lake follows the longtime pals and <a href=#>Real Housewives of New York City</a> costars as they attempt to bring some of their urbane charm to a town with a population of just 7,000. Over the course of eight episodes, the duo go mudding, catch catfish and drive tractors, among other things.</p><p>Lesser friendships might have <a href=#>crumbled under the weight</a> of so many unusual stressors, but Sonja and Luann had no such problem. “One of the greatest things that came out of this trip is that Luann and I always make it work,” Sonja explained. “We come to a happy medium, and neither of us are wrong. We just have different and opinions on things.”</p><p>Luann agreed, though if the pals land a season 2 she’s hoping they get the chance to film in a more temperate locale. “It was hot. I mean, beyond,” she recalled of Benton. “It’s the only place I’ve ever been where if it rains, it gets hotter.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Luann & Sonja: Welcome to Crappie Lake premieres on Bravo Sunday, July 9, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BjxrR50qilo5ldoryzs8CnZKysmaG5bsDEsausZZ2Wu26%2Fx55kpp2kYryvecKrmKmomZp6ra3KnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
