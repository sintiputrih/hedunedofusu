Rudd looked to have a blast at his first experience of the beautiful game in all its glory, and he even secured the footage that will live with the owners forever after they let their emotions get the better of them at full-time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2Fuq3NZqmesZ6kuaW%2FjKCcratdpMOmvtahnKWllZl6o8WMnqSorJmku26u1K1kpa2ToLatxYypmK6kXafCpbCMsJisZaSdsrOxjK2mZpuRpcG2vsRmq6GdXaK8rrHNrWSopl2Yrq6x0Zpm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
