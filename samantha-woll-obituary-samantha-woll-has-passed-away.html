In this moment of deep grief and disbelief, our hearts ache, and our thoughts are with Samantha’s family and loved ones. It is with heavy hearts that we try to put into words the profound impact she had on our organization and the countless lives she touched throughout her dedicated service.</p><p>Samantha was not just a leader; she was the embodiment of our organization’s mission and values. Her unwavering commitment, dedication, and passion for our cause were evident in every decision she made and every action she took. As the President of our Board, she provided vision, leadership, and guidance, setting an example for us all to follow.

Her kindness and generosity were boundless, and her smile could brighten even the darkest days.</p><p>At this point, we do not have more information about the circumstances of Samantha’s passing. We are cooperating with authorities and will share more details as they become available. In the meantime, we encourage all members of our organization and the community to come together in remembrance of Samantha. Let us cherish the moments we shared with her, the wisdom she imparted, and the profound impact she had on our lives and the causes we hold dear.</p><p>In Jewish tradition, it is customary to say, “May her memory be a blessing.” Samantha’s memory will indeed be a blessing to us all. Her legacy will live on through the work we continue to do in her honor, and the positive change she instilled in our hearts. We will miss her deeply, but her spirit will remain a guiding light for our organization and a reminder of the difference one person can make in the world.
