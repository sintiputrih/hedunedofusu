She has been her husband’s rock of support and the driving force behind his success.</p><h2>Aside from family, her hubby finds leisure in playing the piano.</h2><p>Aside from his family, another form of pleasure for him is playing the piano, which he has loved since he was a child.&nbsp;Even though the match was a disaster, he likes playing the piano. He is well-versed in all piano genres.&nbsp;His mother, Ingrid, a boutique owner and music and fashion enthusiast, instilled in him a love of the piano.&nbsp;Not only was his mother interested in the arts, but so was his father. Gilbert, his father, is a talented painter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sandra-Hasenhuttl-1.jpg><h2>She tested positive for the Coronavirus.</h2><p>Sandra tested positive for Coronavirus on December 28th, 2020. However, there were no signs of the infection. Although she had no symptoms, her husband separated himself per official regulations. Because of a possible false-positive result, he was quickly released from isolation. The day following the positive impact, she and her whole family were given a Covid test, but everyone tested negative, including her. On December 31st, the entire family tested negative once again. As a result, Ralph returned to work, believing the initial report to be incorrect.</p><h2>Mother of two children</h2><p>Sandra is the mother of Patrick and Philipp, two kids she shares with her husband, Ralph.&nbsp;Patrick, her eldest son, was born in 1997 and is a professional footballer who presently plays for Liga team SpVgg Unterhaching after formerly playing for Ingolstadt 04 II and Turkgucu Munchen.&nbsp;Philipp, her second son, is two years younger than Patrick and has chosen a vocation other than football.</p><h2>Success is the outcome of perseverance.</h2><p>Ralph has become a successful manager, yet he did not do this overnight. He said that he was not a very gifted football player, but he was highly dynamic. Though he did not have a spectacular playing career, his desire to learn more and improve encouraged him to work harder, propelling him to greater heights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sandra-Hasenhuttl-2.jpg><p>He was always learning something new. He attributes his success to hard effort on the field, which is unstoppable when their games flow.&nbsp;Ralph guided his old team, RB Leipzig, to a second-place finish in the 2016-17 season, advancing to the Champions League and Europa League quarterfinals.</p><p>After taking over at Southampton, he secured Premier League status in 2019 and ended the season in 16th position, followed by an 11th-place finish in 2020, their highest performance in three seasons.&nbsp;However, after temporarily leading the Premier League standings at the start of the 2020-21 season, they ended in 15th position.</p><h2>Ralph prefers to be recognized by his name rather than by Klopp’s.</h2><p>Ralph has earned the moniker “The Alpine Klopp” due to his similar playing style of regaining control of the ball soon after losing it rather than dropping back to recover. They also have a tight bond. However, he is not pleased with the moniker that has been assigned to him. He aspires to be recognized as his persona and by his given name. He says his ultimate ambition is to make his name known in the Premier League, and his choice to join Southampton is personal.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p>Sandra’s net worth has not been reported.<strong> As of now, we know her husband Ralph’s net worth, which ranges between €6 million and €8 million as of December 2023.</strong></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqaUp65utMCsnKegpanBrXnApaNmmZKkwrV50ZqjqaBdna60sc2hrK2snGLEqrLEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
