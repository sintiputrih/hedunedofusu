The<i> 13 Reasons Why </i>executive producer, 25, <a href=#>rode alongside</a> on-again, off-again boyfriend Bieber in Los Angeles in November 2017. It was one of the first public sightings of the pair — who were first linked in 2011 — as they hung out again following Gomez’s <a href=#>October 2017 split from</a> <a href=#><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a>.</p><p>Their rekindled romance seemed to be growing as the pair started stepping out together more and more, including <a href=#>various trips</a> to their church. In February, they were seen taking in the sun in Jamaica, where the couple were on hand to <a href=#>celebrate the wedding</a> of Bieber’s father.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But as <i>Us Weekly</i> exclusively reported, the Disney alum and the “Sorry” singer, 24, have recently <a href=#>paused their relationship</a> — for several reasons. A major point of contention for Gomez is that her family, especially her mother<strong> Mandy Teefy</strong>, have had a hard time accepting their reunion due to their past tumultuous relationship. An insider told Us, “Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed … but her family just isn’t budging right now.”</p><p>Another source explained the break is due to Bieber’s attitude, saying he “doesn’t care about anyone but himself. The second [Gomez] saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health.” The “Same Old Love” singer, who <a href=#>underwent a kidney transplant</a> last summer, “knows she doesn’t need him,” added the source.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bieber has <a href=#>also showed face</a> since news of their break was reported: he attended the <i>Midnight Sun</i> premiere on Thursday, March 15, to support friend <a href=#><strong>Patrick Schwarzenegger</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZyau6J5xqiknrJdnLymv4yfpqtlkp64pnnRopueZZGitqV5waucmqNdm7%2BwuYyjrKysmaN6o7XEm5yrZaCesHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
