He also remarried to a woman named Venessa Villanueva in 2001 and had two children with her, but sadly, their marriage ended in 2008.</strong></p><p><strong>Selena’s family have also been able to lead a seemingly normal life with her brother, <span class=w8qArf>Abraham Quintanilla III carrying on with his career in music and her sister living away from the media. </span></strong><strong><span class=w8qArf>However, the family has been involved in the production of several projects aimed at honoring Selena’s legacy.</span></strong></p><p>Music biopics are presently dominating Hollywood with the likes of Freddie Mercury and Elton John getting their own films about their lives and legacy. Another musician whose biopic was much anticipated was Selena Quintanilla due to her tragic death. The first one, Selena, released in 1997 had J Lo playing the titular role.</p><p>The Mexican-American singer who held sway in the 90s and released several chart-topping albums was tragically shot dead by her friend turned business partner, Yolanda Saldivar who was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p>Selena’s demise led to an outpouring of grief, especially in her home state of Texas. Her funeral attracted tens of thousands of mourners and she was buried on the 3rd of April 1995.</p><p>Quintanilla popularised the Tejano subgenre of Latin music and rose to become one of the bestselling Latina artists of all time. Her family produced the Netflix biographical drama Selena: The Series which premiered in 2020 and hopes to shed more light on the life and death of the music star.</p><p>The Netflix series has no doubt refreshed memories in the hearts of those who hold the singer dear, including her late husband Chris Pérez.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Chris Perez’s Biography</strong></h3><table id=tablepress-524 class="tablepress tablepress-id-524"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1><strong>Age/Date of Birth:</strong><br></th><th class=column-2>Born: 16 April 1971<br>Died: : 31 March 1995</th></tr><tbody class=row-hover readability=2><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Height:</strong><br></td><td class=column-2>5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Ethnicity/Race:</strong><br></td><td class=column-2>Multiracial</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td class=column-2>American</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1><strong>Husband or Boyfriend:</strong></td><td class=column-2>Chris Pérez (married from 1992–1995)</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even" readability=2><td class=column-1><strong>Parents:</strong></td><td class=column-2>Mother: Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora)<br>Father: Abraham Quintanilla Jr.</td></tr></tbody><tr class="row-7 odd"><th class=column-1><strong>Net Worth:</strong></th><th class=column-2>$10 Million</th></tr></table><h2><strong>Who Was Selena Quintanilla’s Husband?</strong></h2><p>Selena Quintanilla’s Husband was Chris Pérez. Theirs was a love story that could make for an interesting romantic movie which makes its tragic ending even more unfortunate, they would have gone on to become one of the biggest power couples in the Latin entertainment industry.</p><p>They had first met when Perez joined her band in 1989, they soon fell in love but Selena’s father disapproved of it because he viewed Perez as a chauvinist who would hinder his daughter’s career.</p><p>Selena and Perez succeeded in hiding their romance for some time but her father later found out he fired Perez from the band, but this was not enough to quench their flame as the couple continued to see each other clandestinely.</p><p>They eventually eloped and tied the knot on the 2nd of April 1992 and following their nuptials, Selena’s family had no choice but to accept her husband. The couple thus remained together until the singer’s death in 1995.</p><h2><strong>Selena Quintanilla’s Husband Chris Pérez Has Been Committed To Sustaining Her Legacy</strong></h2><p>Following Selena’s death, Chris Pérez has been committed to honoring his wife. One of such times was in 2012 when he released the book To Selena, with Love, the book which chronicled their life together and their love story quickly became a best-seller, receiving rave reviews from fans and critics alike.</p><p>Perez expressed his appreciation to Selena for teaching him the meaning of love and embracing life while expressing sadness about how it was not possible for them to start the family they always dreamed about.&nbsp;Additionally, the book dispelled rumors that were rife on the tabloids that Selena was pregnant when she died.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Selena.jpeg><p>After the book was published, Perez was interviewed by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>CNN</a>, he expressed shock about just how well the book was well received and the outpouring of love from fans.</p><p>He also reflected upon the time of Selena’s demise and said that the reception and response from fans when the book was released shocked him even more than the public’s response at the time of her demise in 1995.</p><p>Perez has together with Selena’s family members attended several events held in honor of his passing wife. He attended the unveiling of Selena’s likeness in LA.’s Madame Tussauds wax museum in 2016, and also a year later in 2017 when she was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>The Grammy-winning singer has also performed several benefit concerts in the name of his wife including the Selena For Sanctuary charity concert which was truncated due to the ravaging Covid pandemic.</p><h3><strong>Following&nbsp;</strong><strong>Selena Quintanilla’s Death,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chris Perez Has Continued to Pursue His Music Career&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Chris Perez has attributed his success with life especially with the music industry to the legacy his wife left behind. As Selena y Los Dinos, the band he was a part of with Selna became defunct after Selena’s death, Perez resumed recording new music under his Chris Pérez Band.</p><p>The band released its debut album titled Resurrection in 1999, the album included songs that Perez wrote about his wife while he grieved her demise, “Best I Can,” one of the songs in the album was particularly dedicated to Selena. At the 2000 Grammy Awards, the album won Perez a Grammy for Best Latin Rock/Alternative album.</p><p>Perez’s band released their second album Una Noche Más&nbsp;in 2002. It would also be his final album with the band, however, this does not mean that Perez has since remained idle in the music industry, in the subsequent years that followed, he joined two cumbia groups that recorded more than average success.</p><p>One of those bands was the Kumbia Kings and the other, Kumbia All-Starz. Though the later band last released an album in 2010, Chris Perez has continued to record music, in April of 2020, Perez with his Chris Perez band,&nbsp; released a song titled “Just Say Goodbye.”</p><h2><strong>Chris Perez Remarried A Mystery Woman In 2001, Six Years </strong><strong>After Selena’s Death</strong></h2><p>Six years after Selena’s demise, Chris Perez was ready to give marriage another try. He married a lady named Vanessa Villanueva in 2001. They kept their romance very private as not so much is known publicly about the woman.</p><p>In 2008, news surfaced that the two had gone their separate ways, however, the reason for their split has remained unknown. Perez had kids with Vanessa, a daughter named Cassie who was born in 1999 two years before they were officially married, and a son named Noah born in 2005.</p><p>From Perez’s Instagram posts, it is obvious that he maintains a close and loving relationship with his two kids. They seemed to have inherited their dad’s love for music, while son Noah plays the drums, his daughter Cassie is a vocalist.</p><h2><strong>Selena Quintanilla Family Members</strong><strong> Have Also Been Committed To Keeping Her Legacy</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/selena-quintanillas-family-e1614772250234.jpg><p>Selena Quintanilla hailed from a family of five.

Amidst the pandemic in April 2020, the charity organisation presented Corpus Christi’s Coastal Bend Food Bank with a donation of&nbsp;$25,000&nbsp;to help empower lower-income families in South Texas. Although the musical group Selena y Los Dinos could not survive after Quintanilla was shot and killed in 1995, music still remains a big part of the family’s lives.</p><p>AB Quintanilla III formed the band Kumbia Kings. He left the group in 2006 and formed Elektro Kumbia in 2016.</p><table id=tablepress-525 class="tablepress tablepress-id-525"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Profile Summary</th><th class=column-2></th></tr><tbody class=row-hover readability=16.5><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1>First Name:</td><td class=column-2>Selena</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Last Name:</td><td class=column-2>Quintanilla-Pérez</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1>Also Known As:<br></td><td class=column-2>"Queen of Tejano music"</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1>Sex/Gender:<br></td><td class=column-2>Female</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even" readability=6><td class=column-1>Profession:<br></td><td class=column-2>Singer, songwriter, model, actress, and fashion designer</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd" readability=3><td class=column-1>Famous For:</td><td class=column-2>Signature sonf , "Como la Flor"</td></tr><tr class="row-8 even" readability=4><td class=column-1>Colleges/Universities Attended:<br></td><td class=column-2>Pacific Western University</td></tr><tr class="row-9 odd" readability=4><td class=column-1>Educational Qualifications:<br></td><td class=column-2>Degree in Business administration</td></tr><tr class="row-10 even"><td class=column-1>Religion:<br></td><td class=column-2>Jehovah's Witness</td></tr><tr class="row-11 odd"><td colspan=2 class=column-1><strong>Birthday & Zodiac</strong><br></td></tr><tr class="row-12 even" readability=2><td class=column-1>Age/Date of Birth:<br></td><td class=column-2>Born: 16 April 1971<br>Died: : 31 March 1995</td></tr><tr class="row-13 odd"><td class=column-1>Zodiac Sign:</td><td class=column-2>Aries</td></tr><tr class="row-14 even" readability=4><td class=column-1>Birth Place:<br></td><td class=column-2>Lake Jackson, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr class="row-15 odd"><td class=column-1>Nationality:</td><td class=column-2>American</td></tr><tr class="row-16 even"><td class=column-1>Ethnicity/Race:<br></td><td class=column-2>Multiracial</td></tr><tr class="row-17 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1>Country of Residence:<br></td><td class=column-2>United States of America (USA)</td></tr><tr class="row-18 even"><td colspan=2 class=column-1><strong>Physical Attributes</strong><br></td></tr><tr class="row-19 odd"><td class=column-1>Height:<br></td><td class=column-2>5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m)</td></tr><tr class="row-20 even"><td class=column-1>Weight:<br></td><td class=column-2>57 Kg (126 lbs)</td></tr><tr class="row-21 odd"><td class=column-1>Eye Colour:<br></td><td class=column-2>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr class="row-22 even"><td class=column-1>Hair Color:<br></td><td class=column-2>Black</td></tr><tr class="row-23 odd"><td class=column-1>Other Body Measurements:<br></td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr><tr class="row-24 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Relationships</strong><br></td><td class=column-2></td></tr><tr class="row-25 odd"><td class=column-1>Marital Status:<br></td><td class=column-2>Married</td></tr><tr class="row-26 even" readability=2><td class=column-1>Spouse/Partner:<br></td><td class=column-2>Chris Pérez (married from 1992–1995)</td></tr><tr class="row-27 odd"><td colspan=2 class=column-1><strong>Family and Relatives</strong><br></td></tr><tr class="row-28 even"><td class=column-1>Father:<br></td><td class=column-2>Abraham Quintanilla Jr.</td></tr><tr class="row-29 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1>Mother:</td><td class=column-2>Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora)</td></tr><tr class="row-30 even" readability=2><td class=column-1>Children:<br></td><td class=column-2>2 children- Noah and Cassie</td></tr><tr class="row-31 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1>Siblings:</td><td class=column-2>Suzette Quintanilla - Sister<br>A.B.
