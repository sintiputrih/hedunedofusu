After a career that has taken her through genres such as pop, country, jazz, rock, and many others, Crow has sold more than 50 million records worldwide. Critics appreciate her contribution to the world of music, and she has won countless awards – including 9 Grammys. In addition, Sheryl regularly appears on various television shows as an actress.</p><p><strong>Early Life: </strong>Sheryl Suzanne Crow was born on February 11th of 1962 in Kennett, Missouri. She was raised in a Presbyterian household alongside three siblings by parents who were both musicians. Sheryl became interested in both music and athletics from an early age, and in addition to joining the track team at high school, she won a beauty contest during her teen years.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Crow attended the University of Missouri’s School of Music, studying music composition, performance, and education. During her college years, she also joined a local band called Cashmere and a sorority. Eventually, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p><p><strong>Career: </strong>&nbsp;After graduating from university, Sheryl took a job as a music teacher at a Missouri elementary school. As a side job, she recorded jingles for commercials and earned about $40,000 after singing on a McDonald’s commercial. She then became a backing vocalist for Michael Jackson and toured with him in the late 80s. This led to more job opportunities as a background vocalist for artists like Stevey Wonder and Don Henley.</p><p>Crow initially planned to release her debut album in 1992, but she was not happy with what she had recorded. She and her record label both agreed that it wasn’t good enough, and the album was completely scrapped. However, Sheryl Crow found the sound she was looking for when she collaborated with a group called the Tuesday Music Club, consisting of musicians like Kevin Gilbert, Bill Bottrell, and Brian MacLeod.</p><p>She released her debut album, “Tuesday Music Club,” in 1993. Although the album didn’t gain much traction in the first year, Crow was elevated to widespread fame when audiences discovered the track “All I Wanna Do” in 1994. Soon enough, the album was selling well and Sheryl had won three Grammys.</p><p>Further hits came in 1996 with Crow’s second self-titled album. In 1998, she released “The Globe Sessions,” another critically-acclaimed album that contained hits like “My Favorite Mistake.” In 2002, she released the album “C’mon C’mon,” which included the smash hit “Soak Up the Sun.” Her run of well-received albums came to an end in 2005, when she received mixed reviews for her album “Wildflower.”</p><p>Crow bounced back with the album “Detours,” which was released in 2008 and debuted at number two on the charts. She then followed up with “100 Miles From Memphis,” which was released in 2010. In 2011, she left A&M Records and focused on country music for her next album. In 2013, she released “Feels Like Home,” which charted well. In 2017, she returned to the type of music that made her famous in the 90s and released “Me Myself.” She then toured throughout the UK and collaborated with a number of other country singers.</p><p><strong>Film and Television: </strong>In 1999, Crow made her acting debut alongside her then-boyfriend in “The Minus Man.” She has appeared on television shows such as “One Tree Hill,” “30 rock,” “Hannah Montana,” “NCIS: New Orleans,” and a number of reality shows. She often plays herself in television roles. In addition, Sheryl has recorded a number of songs for various film soundtracks.</p><p><strong>Relationships: </strong>Sheryl Crow is famous for having several notable relationships with famous celebrities. During the late 90s, she dated the much older Eric Clapton. She also dated actor Owen Wilson and wrote the song “C’mon C’mon” about him. In addition, she was once engaged to cyclist Lance Armstrong, but they called it off and officially separated in 2006.</p><p><strong>Breast Cancer Diagnosis: </strong>In 2006, Crow underwent surgery to treat a non-invasive form of breast cancer. The surgery was followed by seven weeks of radiation therapy, and she completely recovered. As a result of this experience, she helped the Crow Imaging Center at Funk’s Pink Lotus Breast Center.</p><p><strong>Real Estate: </strong>Sheryl Crow has an extensive real estate portfolio, although she sometimes has trouble selling her properties. In the late 90s, she established a foothold in Hollywood, purchasing a multi-residence compound in the Runyon Canyon area above Los Angeles. She paid $5.3 million for the 10-acre estate and later listed it for almost $16 million. She had trouble selling the property, however, and she had to repeatedly lower the price to garner interest. In 2001, she purchased a property in the suburbs of Nashville for $3.6 million. The estate sits on 49.5 acres of land.</p><p>In 2003, she purchased a property on Rosa Beach in Florida for $1 million. In 2007, Crow purchased Cross Creek Farm. Located just south of Nashville, the property includes a working farm and 146 acres. Sheryl split the farm into two separate properties and put them on the market. She listed the main property (which includes the main house and 51 acres) for $5.8 million but later slashed the price down to $3.85 million.</p><p>In 2014, it was reported that Sheryl had purchased three parcels of land in Nashville for $650,000. Altogether, this amounts to about 16 acres, and it’s not clear what she plans to do with the raw land, as almost nothing has been built on it aside from few docks along the Cumberland River. In 2015, Sheryl Crow purchased another property near Nashville for $1.2 million. The house spans about 4,500 square feet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuYmr%2B6uIycqaivo2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrCivsSeqWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMn5icrF2Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
