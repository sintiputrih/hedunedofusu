Stephanie made her first appearance on&nbsp;The Hills&nbsp;in November 2007, midway through season 3.</p><p>The Pratts’ rocky relationship was evident from the start, with Spencer frequently getting into fights with his sister that left her in tears. Whether they argued about her friendship with his rival <a href=#><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong></a> or over her sensitivity, the pair were often at odds.</p><p>Spencer married costar <a href=#><strong>Heidi Montag</strong></a> in November 2008. Shortly after the nuptials, Stephanie claimed that her brother and her sister-in-law <a href=#>did not want her involved in their lives</a>. (The couple welcomed son Gunner in October 2017.)</p><p>The Hills ended in July 2010 after six seasons. However, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed in August 2018 that MTV planned to <a href=#>stage a comeback via The Hills: New Beginnings</a>. The revival, which is set to premiere in June 2019, will feature Montag, Spencer, Stephanie, <a href=#><strong>Audrina Patridge</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Whitney Port</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a> and more familiar faces. Conrad and <a href=#><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></a> will not appear.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As the premiere date approached, Stephanie revealed during an April 2019 episode of her “Pratt Cast” podcast that <a href=#>she and Spencer are not speaking</a>, blaming Montag for the estrangement. “The behavior that I’ve seen … I’m done. This is why I moved to London,” she explained. “They are the most toxic people I’ve ever met. They are Bonnie and Clyde till they die. So if they say, ‘The sky is black,’ all of us are morons for saying, ‘It’s blue.’ … I’m going to expose them for who they are.”</p><p>Scroll to relive Spencer and Stephanie’s rocky relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLGxzZycq2Wgp661wIyapZ1lo6mysbTAp6CeZaCnrrXA0maqopqcnruoecOrmKaZXam2rrHLoqWeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
