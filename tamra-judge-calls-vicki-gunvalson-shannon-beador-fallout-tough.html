“I backed out of the ‘Tres Amigas’ for some reasons that you probably will hear about on Orange County Housewives,” Judge, 56, told Entertainment Tonight in an interview published on Friday, January 12, referring to her previous partnership with costars Vicki Gunvalson and Shannon Beador. “You know, it’s tough.”
She continued: “It’s so twisted, and there’s so many layers to it, it’s hard for me to explain everything — but I didn’t do anything to either one of them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Things turned a corner in November 2023 when Judge revealed that <a href=#>they had a disagreement</a> after their debut “Tres Amigas” comedy show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/RHOCs-Tamra-Judge-Says-Fallout-With-Vicki-Gunvalson-and-Shannon-Beador-Is-So-Twisted-2.jpg><p class=p1><i>“</i>After we did the Phoenix show, the agent called me and said, ‘Would you like to do another show?’ and I said, ‘You know what? I really, I can’t right now. I have too much, too many things on my plate. I can’t go on this tour with them,’” Judge recalled on Friday. “They had already known that, they know my schedule’s super busy. I just didn’t have a lot of time to go traveling, and I guess Vicki didn’t like that.”</p><p class=p1>Two months later, <a href=#>Gunvalson threw shade at Judge</a> via social media. After Judge tweeted in December 2023 about joining season 2 of Peacock’s <i>The Traitors</i>, Gunvalson replied that it was the “perfect show for you.”</p><p class=p1>Judge also thinks that Gunvalson and Beador had been mean-spirited “behind [her] back,” accusations that they have not addressed.</p><p class=p1>“There were some things they had said about me behind my back that got to me, and it didn’t sit well with me,” Judge alleged to <i>ET</i>. “In 2024, I’m not going to be around toxic people that are, you know — if you’re my friend, be my friend. If I’m doing something or saying something you don’t like, come to me and tell me. That’s what <strong>Teddi [Mellencamp]</strong> does with me. We hold each other accountable.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Judge and former <i>RHOBH </i>star Mellencamp, 42, cohost the “Two T’s in a Pod” podcast and are set to headline a joint live show later this year. Gunvalson, meanwhile, threw shade at the announcement via X (formerly Twitter) earlier in January.</p><p class=p1>“They knew I was doing that!” Judge told the outlet. “I told them months ago that I was doing it. It’s a one-time thing that was put on by [our podcast company] iHeart. So it wasn’t to take [the Tres Amigas show’s] place. … I hope [Vicki and Shannon] sell a lot of tickets.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmZ2nrm621J2enmWTlrmtv4yvoJyjmWK0trrVmqOsp55iwKmtzaemp2WSmq6lu9FmnZqknKTCtXnTqKygoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
