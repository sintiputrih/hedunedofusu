Weirder things have happened, especially as fandoms nowadays can be a tad on the obsessive side. And who are we to judge? We have our fair share of geeks in the newsroom. That being said, Swift is currently in the thick of her Eras Tour, which recently left Tennessee, and will move on to Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in the coming weeks. Even as she’s touring the States, Swift has stayed devoted to social media, ensuring to update her adoring fans as often as possible to keep those without tickets involved in her escapades.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>But Swifties — as eagle-eyed as they are — have noticed a pattern in Swift’s most recent tweets. We can neither confirm nor deny if Swift’s tweets are symbolic of something to come, but Swifties are utterly convinced. In her most recent tweet concerning a late-night show in the pouring rain, Swift capitalizes “Well” at the beginning of the paragraph, which seems to follow a theme with her other tweets.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>WELL. We had our first rain show of The Eras Tour. And it was SO MUCH FUN. The dancers, band, crowd and I all pretty much turned into little kids joyfully jumping in puddles all night. I wanted to thank the crowd again for waiting for the weather to clear. And my amazing crew for… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OqdtiQaGhU</a></p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>May 9, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>Swifties have noticed that the last few tweets have included a word beginning with ‘W’ being capitalized. This could be an innocent coincidence that adheres to Swift’s typing style and/or text tone, which doesn’t seem entirely out of the ordinary. However, there’s always a slight chance that Swift could be teasing her fans in the most ingenious way possible. This is all just speculation right now, but take a look at her recent tweets and see for yourself:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Even though we have one last show in Nashville tonight I just have to post these photos causeeeee… it’s been WILD.

Could the letter ‘W’ have some significance to a future Swift project? And what might it be? We could be staring at a new single, an album, another upcoming tour. Who knows? But we can’t wait to find out, even if it amounts to absolutely nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46tmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmm5GjwW6x1Z6lZpuRpba1rcuisZ5lkWLAqrrGpZxmr5%2BnsW7DyK2fqK2kYsC4tcWtoJ6rXajBor7ToqWgZZOku7S8yKuYnLFdqbWmu9GinKxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
