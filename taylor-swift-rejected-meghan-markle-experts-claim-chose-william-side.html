This royal commentator certainly seems to think so.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-reportedly-turned-down-meghan-markle>Taylor Swift Reportedly Turned Down Meghan Markle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Taylor Swift's post for Prince William's birthday, <strong>royal experts became convinced that she is choosing sides</strong> in one of the biggest divides in the royal family feud. This rumor was fueled when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">royal commentator Kinsey Schofield</a> revealed that Meghan Markle had sent a note to Taylor, attempting to establish a relationship, but was politely turned down.</p><p>"<strong>She wrote her a handwritten letter and Taylor's team rejected it</strong>," the expert explained. "Megan also later released through People magazine that she had spent some time at a Taylor Swift concert. So I think we are seeing our Taylor side with Team Wales."</p><p>The royal commentator also expanded on Taylor Swift and Prince William’s great rapport.</p><p>"I think that he's [Prince William] probably spent a few minutes with her [Taylor]. We know that they took a selfie. <strong>She has spent time with him previously</strong>, there is a great video of them singing with Jon Bon Jovi at a charity event."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kinsey Schofield commented on <a href=#>the comparison between Prince William and Prince Harry’s attitudes at concerts</a> as well.</p><p>“A lot of people pointing out the pictures of Meghan and Harry at the Beyoncé concert, where Harry looks pretty miserable versus Prince William shaking his tail feather at the Taylor Swift concert. You're just seeing that Prince William is pursuing joy. And I think that is important," the expert concluded.</p><h2 id=travis-kelce-praised-prince-william-after-meeting-him>Travis Kelce Praised Prince William After Meeting Him</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-4.jpg><p>Travis and Jason Kelce, who of course were at Taylor's show, also got to meet Prince William and were admittedly delighted with him. Travis did not hold back on complimenting the heir to the throne, and Jason completely agreed with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<strong>[Prince William] was the coolest motherf***er. They were an absolute delight to me</strong>. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to bow to them or curtsy, or just be an American idiot and shake their hand," he laughed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">during a New Heights episode</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jason-and-travis-kelce.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jason Kelce Insulted Prince William Before Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Hung Out With Him">Jason Kelce Insulted Prince William Before Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Hung Out With Him</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis and Taylor may have been thrilled to see the royals at her London show, but his brother isn't a big fan of the monarchy.</p><p>Jason joined in, saying that his favorite part was meeting Prince William and Kate Middleton's children, especially Princess Charlotte.</p><p>"Prince George was great too, but she was so f***ing adorable,” he gushed. “<strong>I cannot express how much of a superstar she was</strong>. Maybe it’s because I have three girls now, but she had fire to her, she was asking questions. That was the most electric part of it."</p><p>It might be an exaggeration to say they are choosing sides, but it's clear that Taylor and Travis have a great relationship with Prince William, regardless of what that means to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lopq3pq%2FTnptmpZWctaK6jKaYq6OcmnqmxM%2Beqa2rXZi5orXMZpqhp6Oaeri1y6WgmqVdqLalsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
