You can find the well nearby some wooden ruins overlooking the Hyrule Castle Moat. When you locate the well, jump down, and you’ll be on your way to the shrine.</p><h2>How to Complete the Tenmaten Shrine in Tears of the Kingdom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zelda_Tenmaten_Shrine_Cave.jpg><p>Once you have entered the Elma Knolls Well, <strong>you’ll find yourself in a small alcove with Brightcaps and Brightbloom Seeds</strong> scattered around a large hole. Grab these items before heading further down since it will be very dark once you enter the next area.</p><p data-injection=true>Once you jump down the hole, <strong>you’ll fall into some water and be in a very dark alcove</strong>. <strong>Swim north, and you’ll come across some land to get out of the water</strong>. Throw out some Brightbloom Seeds, or use the Miner’s Armor if you have it. Now with some more visibility, you can <strong>make your way down the slope where you will find some Horriblins</strong>, deal with them, and continue down until you reach a large body of water. <strong>It’s worth exploring here first, as you will discover a chest with a royal broadsword, some rocks to mine, and other materials to loot.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zelda_Tenmaten_Shrine_Plank_Boat.jpg><p data-injection=true>By the water’s edge, <strong>you’ll find some planks of wood.</strong> You’ll want to use these to get across the water to the shrine, which you should be able to see across the water, along with a Fire Like. You can <strong>use fans, rockets, or the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zora Armor</a>, whatever you like,</strong> so long as it gets you across. Grab<strong> </strong>the wooden chest near the water’s edge<strong> since this contains a Sapphire.</strong></p><p>Once you are across the water, <strong>take out the Fire Like, and make your way to the shrine.</strong> This shrine is a Raura’s Blessing shrine, so <strong>you don’t need to do anything else once you have made it here.</strong> Just head inside, grab your<strong> </strong>Large Zonai Charge from the chest, and the Lights Blessing. Now you can leave and get back to your adventures.</p><p data-injection=true>And that’s it!
