Their first keyboard, the Alloy FPS, was a simple and compact mechanical keyboard, meant to be easily transportable. Then the Alloy Elite came out, a full-sized keyboard with backlighting and some extra features, yet no programmability. The Alloy Elite RGB, in turn, is essentially a greatly upgraded version of the Alloy Elite, adding RGB lighting, per-key programmability, and local and hard-programmed individual profiles.</p><p>The build quality of HyperX's Alloy Elite RGB is excellent and as expected from a top-tier keyboard. There is no argument that Cherry’s switches are still the best currently used on consumer-level mechanical keyboards and HyperX did an excellent job implementing them on their latest keyboard. The plastic top part of the keyboard is very sturdy and, although it cannot really compare to solid metal, it will definitely take a lot of force to cause real damage. Virtually only a very hard hit or a strong fall on a hard surface should be enough to cause damage but an all-metal design would endure even that kind of abuse.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/13894/Kingston_Alloy_Elite_RGB_15_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In terms of comfort, the version of the Alloy Elite RGB with the Cherry MX RGB Red switches definitely ranks very high. Whether it is used for long gaming hours or for professional use, the Cherry MX Red switches will place the least possible stress to the muscles and tendons, increasing the user’s comfort and reducing the chance of health-related issues in the long run. Professional typists may not approve of the particular switch due to the lack of tactile and audible feedback and HyperX has them covered, as the Alloy Elite RGB is also available with tactile (MX Brown) and audible tactile (MX Blue) switches as well.</p><p>HyperX ’s latest addition to their gaming peripherals is, by all means, an exceptional mechanical keyboard and its current retail price of $140 is rather average for a top-tier keyboard. On the other hand, with an average price it really does not stand out amongst the very tough competition in the mechanical keyboard space, and as a result HyperX is relying more on their brand name and aesthetics than they are tangible superiority. As an added bonus, the very presence of the Alloy Elite RGB in the market though was enough to bring down the price of several other products&nbsp;– including that of HyperX’s own Alloy Elite&nbsp;– so there's been a knock-on effect that has seen simpler mechanical keyboards become more affordable as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH50hJhtZq2glWK1urzEq69mmZyhvLp5xKWgrZ1dp7SjecyemqGZnp6woriMpJyymp%2BWv6V50Z6top2nZII%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
