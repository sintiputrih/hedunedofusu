All he wanted was to track down John Fitzgerald&nbsp;and Jim Bridger and kill them for what they had put him through.</p><p dir=ltr>Because he had been one of William Ashley's mountain men, Glass was able to acquire weapons and other supplies at the fort, even though he had no money or furs to trade. As explained by historian Clay Landry for the <a href=#>Museum of the Mountain Man</a>, Glass heard about a very small group of traders – just five or six men – that were planning to travel about 300 miles to trade with the <a href=#>Mandan</a>. Glass believed that Bridger and Fitzgerald might be at Fort Henry, which was in the same direction. Only a few days after completing his harrowing journey to Fort Kiowa, he set off again.</p><p dir=ltr>The traders traveled by boat. The day before they were supposed to arrive at the Mandan villages where they hoped to trade, Glass once again insisted that he go off on his own. This time, it proved to be a wise decision. Shortly after Glass left, the traders were killed by a group of Arikara. Glass, who was walking in the direction of Fort Henry alone, was rescued by a pair of Mandan men. They helped him reach a nearby trading post, but as night fell, Glass struck out on his own again. He wouldn't give up until he found Bridger and Fitzgerald.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDknFwcWlfqbWmecinmqudlJ6vrbGMramunV2owbC%2B2GaZnqCZo7FuwMeeZKudppq7orrTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
