So much so that Prime Video has not only greenlit a second season but also commissioned a spinoff. With author Jack Carr <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already having written seven of the book series</a> this TV universe is based on, this is surely yet another franchise starring Pratt that can run and run, even if some scoffed at the idea of it becoming a success at first. Dark Wolf? More like Dark Horse.</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>For those eager to see what’s next for Lt. Commander James Reece and his crack squad of Navy SEALs, here’s all you need to know.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-terminal-list-dark-wolf-about data-injectable=false>What is The Terminal List: Dark Wolf about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Chris-Pratt-in-The-Terminal-List.jpg><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>Fans can expect a slightly different flavor from Dark Wolf when compared to The Terminal List as the spinoff is being pitched as an “elevated espionage thriller.” Set five years prior to the events of its parent series, Dark Wolf will focus on Special Operator Ben Edwards, who was a major supporting character in the first season, as he ascends from Navy SEAL to CIA paramilitary operator. Along the way, Edwards will come face to face with the darker side of warfare and witness the human cost that comes with it.</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Although not directly based on one of the novels, Jack Carr co-created Dark Wolf alongside The Terminal List creator and showrunner David DiGilio. Series stars Taylor Kitsch and Chris Pratt are also on board as executive producers, so even if it has a different tone and approach to its story, you can be sure that Dark Wolf will scratch the same itch for viewers thanks to the same talent working behind the camera. And in front of it too, as it happens.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-in-the-terminal-list-dark-wolf data-injectable=false>Who is in The Terminal List: Dark Wolf?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Terminal-List-James-Reece-Ben-Edwards.jpg><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=774 data-injectable=true>With Edwards being bumped up to main character, Taylor Kitsch is of course the lead of this series, reprising his role from The Terminal List. Kitsch himself is almost the anti-Pratt, as she’s been searching for a franchise to call his own for years now, after a one-off appearance in the X-Men universe as Gambit and Disney’s John Carter going down as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most infamous box office flops of all time</a>. So it’s about high time he got his own vehicle.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Surprisingly, Pratt will also be back as James Reece in Dark Wolf, just not as a lead this time. Other series regulars set to join the franchise include The Umbrella Academy alum Tom Hopper as fellow SEAL Raife Hastings and Luke Hemsworth (Westworld) as CIA contractor Jules Landry. Hemsworth might just be the villain of the piece, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Landry’s described</a> as hiding “a dangerously volatile personality beneath his muscled veneer.”</p><h2 id=h-when-will-the-terminal-list-dark-wolf-release-on-prime-video data-injectable=false>When will The Terminal List: Dark Wolf release on Prime Video?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-terminal-list.jpg><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>No official release date has been provided for Dark Wolf as of yet, but it sadly it seems we’ll have to wait a while for it. With filming just beginning as of February 2024, the likelihood is that it won’t hit Prime Video until early 2025. This is going by the way things played out with The Terminal List season 1, which began production in March 2021 and didn’t hit streaming until July 2022.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=false>The good news is that work on The Terminal List season 2 — which will adapt Carr’s second novel, True Believer — is due to begin soon after Dark Wolf completes filming. So a bit of patience will go a long way here as, while we’re lacking for new content for the moment, pretty soon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a bonafide James Reece Cinematic Universe</a> will be available to binge on Prime Video — proof that Chris Pratt is just gonna keep on Chris Pratting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmq56qnZ67oriMpaCsrF2ZrrO3jLCmpZ5dp7KtscCsnGackamybq%2FArKtmmZ6Zeq670Z5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
