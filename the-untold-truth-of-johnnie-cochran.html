For his closing statements, instead of discussing the case, Cochran rambled about the "Star Wars" character Chewbacca, which led to his victories. The episode spawned the term "The Chewbacca Defense," which describes the tactic of using red herrings to confuse an audience or jury instead of arguing the facts. The term has been used to describe political arguments, legal defenses, debates, and many more scenarios.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2016, Courtney B. Vance (pictured) portrayed Cochran in the FX miniseries "The People vs. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story." Vance was awarded an Emmy for "<a href=#>Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie</a>," beating out his co-star Cuba Gooding Jr., who played Simpson himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fl2pqcGtfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2fvKm6zaKcZpufmLWzrc1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
