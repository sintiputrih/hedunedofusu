When we first meet our hero, he is struggling to keep his footing and fight off exhaustion. Throughout the chapter, he keeps repeating “Shin Woosung” and “Father” to himself because he refuses to fail someone essential to him. This chapter takes a look back at the protagonist’s childhood.</p><p>His father had previously owned a company that had failed miserably, leaving him significantly in debt. Members of the group threatened the protagonist’s family with death because they believed the group owed them money. In an attempt to get their money back, members of the group threaten and swear.</p><p>It does make the protagonist’s mother and sister less powerful. The hero makes a selfless choice despite the danger. He decides to join them in order to work out a payment plan for the debt, and this decision sends him on a path that is both perilous and repulsive. The hero actively engages in illegal activities to raise funds for the group.</p><p>He tries to escape from the group once, but they catch him and cripple him so they can hurt him. The most credible character relies on the Haegwang group he joins. Despite what seems like constant upheaval, the protagonist maintains an unwavering dedication to Haegwang and its pioneer. He is willing to die for his boss, Shin Woosung, because of the kindness he has shown him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Read More-&nbsp;<a href=#>Inso’s Law Chapter 200 Release Date and Where To Read</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunCx0qmmq6yjZMGwec2oq2acmZp6pLTAqaueql1mfXp50Z6jnpmjmnqlrdOeZJqmlGLEqbHRnmStp12nsqKwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
