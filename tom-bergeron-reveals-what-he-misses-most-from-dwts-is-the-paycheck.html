News</a>. “There are some people I miss, but I’m really happy not hosting.”</p><p>He also revealed that despite hosting the dance competition for 15 years, he never had the desire to tune in to the show at home. “To be honest, I never watched it when I was hosting it,” he shared. “I watched it while I was there, obviously, but I never watched it as a TV show.”</p><p>Bergeron famously starred on DWTS from season 1 to season 28 before he and his cohost <strong>Erin Andrews</strong> <a href=#>were let go</a> ahead of season 29 in July 2020. “Just informed @DancingABC will be continuing without me. It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career,” he announced via X at the time. “I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made. That said, now what am I supposed to do with all of these glitter masks?”</p><p>The pair’s exit came nearly a year after Bergeron <a href=#>expressed his disapproval</a> of casting former White House press secretary <strong>Sean Spicer</strong> for season 28. “It is the prerogative of the producers, in partnership with the network, to make whatever decisions they feel are in the best long-term interests of the franchise,” Bergeron wrote in a since-deleted tweet. “We can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it’s their call. I’ll leave it to them to answer any further questions about those decisions.”</p><p>At the time, DWTS executive producer <strong>Andrew Llinares</strong> told Us Weekly, “We’ve got a great and diverse cast. We are excited about the season.” Spicer also <a href=#>replied to the drama</a> in a statement to Us, calling Bergeron a “great host” and said bringing “a diverse group of people together, who can interact in a fun, civil and respectful way, is actually a way we can move the country forward in a positive way.” Spicer and his dance partner, <strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong>, ultimately came in sixth place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tom-bergeron-misses-dwts-paycheck-03.jpg><p>Bergeron and Andrew’s axing was met with <a href=#>disappointed reactions</a> from fans and the show’s cast and pro dancers. Llinares later explained in September 2020 that the decision was made to <a href=#>help the long-running show “evolve,”</a> adding, “I think changing the hosts was all about evolution, it was about making the show feel fresh, making it feel new [and] kind of make it reach out — maybe to a new audience as well, as well as the audience that’s been there for years.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The cohosts were <a href=#>replaced by</a> <strong>Tyra Banks</strong>, who exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in September 2020 that it would be a “challenge” to step in their shoes. “[I’m] respecting the stage that they have set and then adding my icing to that,” she stated. “I feel confident about that, but of course, it’s a challenge, but I don’t back away from challenges.”</p><p>Banks, 50, was <a href=#>joined by cohost</a> <strong>Alfonso Ribeir</strong>o for season 31 in 2022, after which she exited the series. <strong>Julianne Hough</strong> <a href=#>took over her spot</a> for season 32 in 2023. Upon returning to DWTS as a host, Ribeiro, 52, exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> that he reached out to discuss the role with Bergeron.</p><p>“We have enough respect for each other that I wanted to talk to him as a friend,” he shared in September 2022. “I wanted to let him know how it went down [with] all the love and respect that I have for Tom.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2XsrOzxKump2WimsOmrcusZLCgkal6qbGMpqCsq5Woeq670q1kn6qfonqlw9OsZKKrXam1pnnPmrCcoJWYuHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
