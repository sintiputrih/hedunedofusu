A fantastic contact hitter, Gwynn earned the record books with numerous distinctions like tying a National League record with eight batting titles as well as picking up seven Silver Slugger and five Gold Glove Awards. His influence on the sport outlasts only individual accolades — he brought the Padres to their first two World Series, shaping the franchise in monumental ways.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Height of Success</h2><p>Gwynn was loaded: He earned plenty during his epic career. In his career, he collected the sum of $47 million salary whose highest-paid season was in 2000 making $6.3 million, which is today like $12 million. He received high-priced contract extensions off of his work on the field, where he had done very well, like a two-year $10.6-million dollar contract extension that lasted through 1999 and 2000. That left Gwynn poised to be self-financed for life.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Financial Setback</h2><p>While his playing career was a triumph, the same could not be said of its financial counterpart. He declared bankruptcy in 1987, claiming $1,147,000 in liabilities and $690,150 in assets. The issue arose from Gwynn co-signing loans in favor of his agent, and later getting rotten financial advice, which opened the gates for his financial ruin. Due to that loyalty to his agent and some poor financial decisions (mainly borrowing large sums of money to live more lavishly), he saw his debts balloon and then eventually go bankrupt. In turn, Gwynn's monetary issues spiraled out of control, as he was ordered to pay $45,000 in delinquent taxes to the IRS, leaving him in even worse financial shape.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Legacy and Legal Battles</h2><p>Sadly, Gwynn's troubles were not simply limited to his bank account. He was killed by salivary gland cancer in 2014 at the age of 54. After his death, Gwynn's family filed suit against the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, saying Gwynn was hopelessly addicted to their product, and they were at fault for his early demise. The company settled the lawsuit ending the legal process for the family.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Impact and Lessons</h2><p>The story of Tony Gwynn is a cautionary tale and a sad demonstration of how even the most successful athlete can end up in financial trouble. Even with all his talent and success on the field, bad money management, loyalty to the wrong people, and unexpected health problems conspired to keep the Hall of Famer from being able to get ahead of his finances.&nbsp;<br data-mce-fragment=1>Ultimately, Tony Gwynn went from the top of the mountain to the depths of monetary despair, and his story should act as a tale of caution for all athletes. His impact is felt on the diamond, but this will forever be a real-life example of how detrimental it is to be passive with your finances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfqbyvxYygrrKmnmLBqbGMoqWsmZ6aeqe1zZqlnKGRoXq1vs6umaWdo2Kur7CMnZybrF2ks26tjJuYrJ2Slrmtecuenp6mlA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
