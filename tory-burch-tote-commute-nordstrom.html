Personally, we love loading up on versatile designs that we can wear anywhere and <a href=# rel=noopener>Tory Burch</a> always tops our list. We love how effortlessly stylish the brand’s designs are and we spotted a <a href=# rel=noopener>tote</a> that will make a great addition to our collection! It’s time for a shopping trip!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tory-Burch-Gemini-Link-Coated-Canvas-Tote.jpg><p><strong>See It: Grab the <a href=# rel=noopener>Tory Burch Gemini Link Coated Canvas Tote</a> for 33 percent off the original price of $198, now <a href=# rel=noopener>$133</a> while it’s still in stock.

Check out <a href=# rel=noopener>other Tory Burch bags</a> at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Nordstrom Half-Yearly Sale</a> today!</strong></p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Tory Burch Gemini Link Coated Canvas Tote</a> is unlike any style we’ve ever seen! A beautiful creation for those who are looking to steer away from classic solid designs, this bag has the potential to give our statement handbag a run for its money!</p><p>Designed with a link motif, this patterned number will make quite the statement with our wardrobe. A beautiful blend of green, blue and white hues, this number will upgrade our year-round ensembles with ease.</p><p>Made with the classic construction that we love, the extra-large interior will work wonders for storing our everyday essentials and more. From a 15-inch laptop, wallet, keys and other daily necessities, this bag will redefine the way we look at tote bags! There is also an interior zip pocket that can keep our small items like keys or a lip balm handy for easy access. We also dig its snap-tab closure that provides extra security while we’re out and about.</p><p>What we love most about this design is the water-resistant coated canvas! We never know what Mother Nature will throw our way, but thanks to this tote we can keep our valuables nice and dry. This functional design will keep Us organized and stylish as we tackle our day.</p><p>We’re also fans of its leveled bottom. The perfect shape that will give the bag a seamless sitting stance, we can keep our purse as clean as possible. Complete with top carry handles, we can tuck this bag over our shoulder for easy wear.</p><p>Best of all? We can enjoy this style without having to break the bank! Normally retailing for $ 198, we were excited to see a 33 percent off markdown, leaving Us with a <a href=# rel=noopener>$133 price tag!</a> Now, that’s what we call a sweet deal!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tory-Burch-Gemini-Coated-Canvas-Tote.jpg><p>Nordstrom shoppers are totally smitten over this design! Many reviewers love the unique detailing and roomy construction, while others love that it’s the perfect size for all occasions. Shoppers also dig that this bag provides a lightweight feel despite what you carry, while others love that its durable and goes with absolutely everything.</p><p>Many reviewers also love that this creation sits up comfortably and that it looks exactly like the pictures online. &nbsp;Shoppers also like that it fits perfectly on the shoulders, while others like that this style can substitute as a baby bag!</p><p>There is a medley of ways we can style this tote and we plan on wearing Ponte pants, waterproof boots, a peplum top and a trench coat for a chic rainy day look. For days when we’re traveling out of town, we’re pulling out jogger pants, a basic V-neck tee, a longline cardigan and slip-on <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> for a comfy ensemble. We can even dress this bad boy up with skinny jeans, a long sleeve bodysuit, a moto leather jacket and knee-high boots for a glamorous look.</p><p>We can even keep our look cool and casual with leggings, knit sneakers, an oversized sweater and a top coat for a laidback look. Whether we’re keeping our style relaxed or flirting with a dressy ensemble, this tote will go the distance with every wear.</p><p>If you’re in need of a stylish handbag, it truly doesn’t get any better than this! A fabulous deal that allows Us to make a bold statement without the hefty price tag, this design is well worth the hype.</p><p><strong>See It: Grab the <a href=# rel=noopener>Tory Burch Gemini Link Coated Canvas Tote</a> for 33 percent off the original price of $198, now <a href=# rel=noopener>$133</a> while it’s still in stock.
