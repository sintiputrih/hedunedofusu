He was initially annoyed that it took fans a minute to discover “the Travis that’s with Kourtney also plays drums in Blink.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s what I f—k do. <a href=#>I’m a drummer</a>. Celebrity is not my identity. Or Kourt’s,” he told the outlet “She’s so different than her sisters.” Kourtney is the eldest of her five siblings, followed by <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Rob Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>.</p><p>Barker went on to credit his and Kourtney’s marriage with helping him heal from the trauma of his <a href=#>2008 plane crash</a>, which killed four people and left him with <a href=#>third-degree burns</a> on 65 percent of his body. “I think the power of love really helped me,” he shared. “Kourt made it so I fly, my kids fly now. She healed us.”</p><p>In April 2021, Kourtney took her then-boyfriend on his <a href=#>first flight since the accident</a> along with her mom, <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, and Kris’ boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Corey Gamble</strong></a>. The group departed on a private jet to travel from Los Angeles to Cabo, Mexico. One year later, he traveled via plane once again for his and Kourtney’s <a href=#>May 2022 wedding ceremony</a> in Portofino, Italy, which documented earlier this year in the Hulu special <a href=#>Til Death Do Us Part</a>.</p><p>It was the couple’s nuptials that <a href=#>sparked a feud</a> between Kourtney and Kim, 43. Four months after Kourtney walked down the aisle in a <a href=#>Dolce and Gabbana dress</a>, she accused Kim of using her wedding as a “business opportunity” as Kim teamed with the fashion label for a <a href=#>Milan Fashion Week collaboration</a> in September 2022.</p><p>Kim followed up Kourtney’s accusations by explaining she did not select any items Kourtney wore at the wedding for her collaboration — and pointed out similarities between Kourtney’s wedding and her 2014 overseas nuptials with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Barker-Says-Kourtney-Kardashian-Is-So-Different-Than-Her-Sisters-After-Kim-Kardashian-Feud3.jpg><p>“I got married in Italy. Am I saying you copied me by getting married in Italy? Who performed at my wedding? <a href=#><strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong></a>. Who performed at Kourtney’s wedding? Andrea Bocelli,” Kim <a href=#>claimed in a confessional</a> during a July episode of The Kardashians. “You stole my f—king wedding country and my wedding performer. Andrea Bocelli is my favorite male singer of all time, but I am copying your Dolce Vita lifestyle?”</p><p>The sisters <a href=#>ultimately made amends</a> during the show’s October 12 episode after Kourtney reached out by sending Kim a picture of their late father, <a href=#>Robert Kardashian</a>, in college.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, fans have continued to speculate that Barker played a part in the pair’s feud as he called Kim “hot” in his 2015 memoir, <a href=#>Can I Say</a>.</p><p>Barker <a href=#>called the speculation “ridiculous”</a> in his interview with the Los Angeles Times, adding, “I obviously shared all that stuff because I wanted to move past it. It was therapeutic for me. … That’s her sister. She knows we used to talk. Nothing bad was going on. You give people a little information and they think they’ve solved the mystery of ‘this is why they’re fighting.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5wZqppJ2iYsCixdJmoqitoqm7psWMpJirnJGotaqtzWagrGWjpHqltcWfnKudnql6tbTAp2ShnaJiwKq%2F056prGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
