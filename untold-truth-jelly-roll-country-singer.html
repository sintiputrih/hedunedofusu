They married in 2016, after dating for about a year. One night while in Las Vegas, the Nashville rapper popped the question to the former sex worker — while he was onstage at a Deftones concert. After the concert, he decided they should get hitched right then and there. "I'm like, 'F*** it, let's just go now.' She's like, 'The courthouse is open for like ... 44 more minutes," he said in a <a href=#>TikTok video</a>, revealing they each said "I do" just before midnight.</p><p>At the time that <a href=#>he and Bunnie tied the knot</a>, Jelly Roll's life was a far cry from what it would become. "I was&nbsp;a lost cause, I was in the middle of custody battle, I was broke, living out of van doing 200 shows a year for $200 a show," he wrote in an <a href=#>Facebook</a> tribute to his spouse. As he explained, she quite literally turned his life around. "It was truly the turning point in my career and life,"&nbsp;he added, crediting Bunnie with helping him get custody of daughter Bailee Ann.&nbsp;</p><p>Bunnie, however, wasn't content to merely be the wife of a successful country-rap star, and forged her own identity with the launch of her "Dumb Blonde Podcast."&nbsp;Among the various guests she's interviewed have been Jelly Roll himself, who appeared in a June 2020 episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtoZoF2g46upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mopWhubp50aijpWWTpMKvwNGyZKyhnpyys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
