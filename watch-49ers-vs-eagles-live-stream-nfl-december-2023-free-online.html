Kickoff is scheduled for <strong>4:25 p.m. ET/1:25 p.m. PT on December 3.&nbsp;</strong>The game airs on Fox and will be called by the network’s top broadcast team –&nbsp; Kevin Burkhardt, Greg Olsen, Erin Andrews, and Tom Rinaldi.</p><p>Last season, the 49ers and Eagles met in the <a href=#>NFC Championship Game</a>. However, it wasn’t much of a competition after Philadelphia knocked 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy out of the game with a right elbow injury. The Eagles then injured Josh Johnson, the 49ers backup, forcing the team to finish the game without a healthy quarterback. Philadelphia went on to win 31-7. Vegas thinks this game will play out differently with a healthy Purdy, as the 49ers are a 2.5-point favorite on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">FanDuel</a>.</p><p>There is a good chance the 49ers and Eagles meet again in the playoffs. These two teams have been the best in the <a href=# data-injected=1>NFC</a> all season. Now, it’s time to see which team holds the upper hand heading into the postseason.
