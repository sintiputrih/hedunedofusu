Learn all about him as this Wesley Richardson Bio proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Wesley Richardson On Gold Rush</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley Richardson describes himself as the “MacGyver” of the group mining for gold on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: White Water</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. This ingenious craftsman has worked with the Hurt brothers for years and surely without his help, the miners would have been in a lot of trouble than they should.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For instance, back when the divers were struggling with one rock basket. He constructed a pair of oversized sleds to out tons of rocks with two of them. “This will probably hold a four or five hundred pound rock — if they can roll it into this thing, we can pull it out,” he said at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That sled later proved to be extremely crucial for the operation.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Wesley is Dakota Fred Hurt and Dustin Hurt’s go-to craftsman whenever they needed some equipment.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For the new </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fans, Wesley didn’t just join the show for its “White Water” spinoff. He’s been a part of it ever since it first aired on Discovery Channel back in 2013.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He’s also been a part of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: The Dirt, Gold Blood</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>All The Glitters</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Wesley Richardson Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley Richardson garnered a net worth of under $500 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He was then working as a designer and test pilot of his self-owned company named&nbsp; </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>New Age Mining Equipment</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. His company was also the manufacturer of The Eliminator series Reverse Helix Gold Trommels — “Proven, effective recovery to 300-mesh minus!”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to him, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>New Age Mining Equipment</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was ideal for sampling and testing in both large and small-scale mining operations. And great for concentrate-clean-up in larger-scale mining operations and prospecting clubs or common dig operations.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides that, Wesley is also a reality star appearing on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: White Water</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, its casts were paid anywhere from $10 – $25 thousand per episode. So, he probably earned somewhere in mid-range of that.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In case you haven’t heard of the show, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was all about documenting gold miners who agreed to film coverage while they are engaging in their work. And just like any other series, it also involved dramas within the co-stars and their families.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Wesley Richardson?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley Richardson was 63 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: White Water</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But though he might have already hit that “old-age” range, Wesley shared that he still felt like in his 40’s then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he is one of the oldest cast on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Wesley Richardson Wife</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley Richardson’s wife is former military personnel named Deborah Erekson Richardson. The duo has been together ever since they were young and shares a daughter named Shawna Misiong.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their daughter, Shawna is a Corpus Christi, Texas-raised child who went on to become an interior designer and the founder of The Eclective, an eclectic collection of home furnishings, decor, and gifts.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, Shawna resided in San Antonio, Texas with her husband Michael Misiong (married on November 8, 2008) and their beautiful two kids.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little about Deborah’s family, she is the daughter of Randall Erekson (who died in 1991) and Marilyn Erekson Lambert. She has two sisters named Celia Lambert Williford (married to Robert) and Linda Drescher, and four brothers named Jeffrey (married to Glenda), Dave, Rick (married to Patty), and Randall “Randy” Kingston Erekson, Jr. (who passed away at the age of 49 in November 2010).</span></p><h3><b>Is Wesley Richardson On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unforautnaly, we couldn’t find Wesley on Instagram.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But, get in touch with him over Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>wesley.richardson.90</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Or, if you’re looking for professional consultation, here’s his FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>New Age Mining Equipment</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and Youtube @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>NewAgeMiningEquipUS</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most of his Youtube videos even showcased his works for extracting gold.</span></p><h3><b>Wesley Richardson Brother</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley Richardson’s brother </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Paul Richardson</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> is also a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: White Water</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star who was forced to leave the show alongside his wife Dustin Hurts after its season 3.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In case you missed that drama, Paul’s wife <a href=#>Kayla</a> had been having issues with her family who had a very traditional outlook on mining. What’s more, her stepbrother, Dustin didn’t even hesitate to say that he doesn’t think women should be in the mining industry.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, to keep Kayla away from mining, her stepbrother Dustin Hurts asked the producers to kick her, or else, he wouldn’t have done the show.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Well, to be honest, Paul didn’t exactly have to leave the show. But being the supportive husband that he is, the star decided to stick by his wife’s side.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Paul was also a regular Gold Rush franchise cast who appeared on its earliest season </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: The Dirt</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> back in 2013.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Wesley Richardson Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley receives his birthday wishes on March 16.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He hails from Corpus Christi, Texas, and resided in Pipe Creek, Texas as of 2022.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Tall Is Wesley Richardson?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>This reality star stands tall at a height under 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Who Are Wesley Richardson’s Parents?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wesley was born to their parents, Paul S. and Jeannette Richardson.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His father, Paul worked for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Beck & Sons</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in Corpus Christi for 25 years and went on to run a machine and fab shop in the same area for 25 years.
