Justin Berfield played Reese Wilkerson in all 151 episodes of the popular series Malcolm in The Middle, but his acting career didn't continue for very long once the show was over. Berfield was great as the spirited and frustrating Reese and really made the character feel real. The actor was 14 when he began starring on Malcolm In The Middle. And when he was 20, the show was done and he was thinking about what would come next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Malcolm In The Middle cast liked making the sitcom</a>. Was that the case for Justin Berfield? And if so, why did he fade away from Hollywood?</p><h2 id=did-justin-berfield-have-a-bad-experience-on-malcolm-in-the-middle>Did Justin Berfield Have A Bad Experience On Malcolm In The Middle?</h2><p>Reese Wilkerson was the kind of sitcom sibling that everyone loves to hate. He could never stop making fun of Malcolm and Dewey. He thought that he was the coolest person around. And while he probably loves his family, he doesn't usually show it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/did-justin-berfield-vanish-from-hollywood-because-of-a-terrible-experience-playing-reese-on-malcolm-in-the-middle_.jpg><p><a href=#>Bryan Cranston and Frankie Muniz got along well</a> and the actors have talked a lot about their bond. Justin Berfield has been much more silent about his time on Malcolm In The Middle. And he hasn't talked much about his life in the years following the show's 2006 cancelation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Malcolm In The Middle ended, Berfield voiced Gill in two episodes of Kim Impossible and Ving in one episode of The Fairly OddParents. He never signed onto another sitcom, though, or even a TV drama. And he didn't become a movie star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/justin-berfield.jpg><p>There isn't any indication that Justin Berfield hated being on Malcolm In The Middle. Since he was 20 when he was done playing Reese, he had his whole life in front of him. And while fans expected him to keep playing parts just like Reese, it doesn't sound like this was exciting to him.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To David Anthony Higgins After Malcolm In The Middle?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor doesn't participate in interviews as much as the Malcolm In The Middle cast. That is probably a choice that he has made.</p><p>However, when Frankie Muniz was interviewed by Independent.co.uk when Malcolm In The Middle had been around for 20 years, the actor shared some sweet memories of life on the sitcom set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/justin-berfield-1.jpg><p>Muniz said that he and Berfield could relate to each other and that made for a good environment on the show.</p><p>Muniz explained to Independent.co.uk, "We were going through the same thing. Justin and I are the same age, and Erik – our lives changed at the same time. It was something we experienced together. Going through those years – 13 to literally 19 or 20 when the show ended – they’re the most important years of your life. You learn so much about yourself and who you want to be. Getting to do that on a show with Jane, Bryan and everyone was an amazing experience. We were very lucky."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-other-movies-and-tv-shows-did-justin-berfield-star-in-after-malcolm-in-the-middle>What Other Movies And TV Shows Did Justin Berfield Star In After Malcolm In The Middle?</h2><p>Justin Berfield never explained why he didn't want to act anymore or why he left his Malcolm In The Middle fame behind. In 2010, he began working as the Chief Creative Officer of Virgin Produced, a production company. And that seems to be making him happy. He might have wanted to be behind the camera instead of in front of it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Erik Per Sullivan's Reclusive Life After Malcolm In The Middle</a></span></p><p>There's an interesting story behind how Justin Berfield and Jason Felts <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began running Virgin Produced</a>. According to Variety, Richard Branson started the business and wanted to find people who could be in charge.</p><p>Berfield explained to Variety, “We are developing and producing films and television shows that are far from traditional. We aren’t afraid to push the envelope with content.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Felts is the CEO of Virgin Produced, which has produced movies such as Bixler High Private Eye, The Space Between Us, The Edge of Seventeen, Bad Moms, and That Awkward Moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/justin-berfield-2.jpg><p>In 2011, the actor was interviewed by Agora Hills Patch and explained that he was happy to swap acting for producing.</p><p>He said, "The point when I realized that I had been on two shows that syndicated to over 100 episodes and that I felt fulfilled as an actor and decided to try my hand at producing. I think people constantly are looking for fulfillment, and nothing is ever good enough, but I feel fortunate enough to have had the journey I have had so far."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Virgin Produced also made the TV series Sons of Tucson, which stars Tyler Labine.

As for how acting and producing compared to each other, he explained, "They’re both unique in their own ways, but I’m enjoying what I’m doing and where I’m at right now. It’s a whole new level of stress. It’s a different kind of stress, but they’re both rewarding."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Bees Did Bryan Cranston Get Stung By When He Wore His Suit Of Live Bees On Malcolm In The Middle?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Justin Berfield only has 28 posts on his Instagram account, he has a daughter who he posts about sometimes. This could be the reason why he has stopped acting. He hasn't posted since January 2023 when he shared that he and his family went on a ski trip. Berfield is married to Liza, although she is even more private than him.</p><p>In the post, he wrote, "This future skier was itching to hit the slopes with dad. Next year it’s on! Also, a huge thanks to everyone in Mammoth working their butts off to keep the mountain and town running during that crazy snowstorm. SEVEN FEET of snow!? I hope to be back soon!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/justin-berfield-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Berfield and his family went to Disneyland in December 2022 and to the beach in September 2021, and he shared those trips as well.</p><p>Many years after Malcolm In The Middle went off the air, Justin Berfield is definitely having an awesome time.
