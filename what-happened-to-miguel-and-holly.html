Today is our last day, and this is our last hour," Miguel said. "A lot of morning shows don't get to do this, unless you are retiring. Because this company has been so amazing to us over the past seven years and they understand the relationship that we have with you, they are allowing us to say goodbye."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During the "Family Meeting," Miguel and Holly shared details about how appearing on The Miguel & Holly Show changed the course of their lives for good.

Thank you for your support and encouragement. Never stop learning about yourself."</p><p>Miguel shared a few words as well: "Almost seven years ago, on March 31, 2015, Holly and I opened up the microphones on one of the biggest radio stations in the country and introduced ourselves to you. In the first few seconds, at 6 a.m. that morning, we said, 'We're perfectly imperfect, and we hope you'd come along for the ride.'"</p><p>"Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine the last seven years going the way they have," he continued.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Miguel listed some of his and Holly's accomplishments, including Miguel and Holly's Book Adventures, Miguel and Holly's Volunteer Squad, Blown Off Ball, Miguel's Big Gay Brunch, and a cookbook, 50 Shades Of Chicken.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I love this medium and what it can do. But your listening has brought it to life," he said. "You let this poor, gay, Black kid from Atlanta, Ga., come here and fulfill his dreams. You know we've always kept it real with you as much as possible, and I won't stop in our final hour ... You have supported us in our crazy vision of being the nice morning show in Tampa Bay, Fla."</p><p>"You showed up to events, listened to us hurt your ears with headphone karaoke, and you spilled your gut with Tampa Bay's secrets. My gratitude to you runs so deep and is everlasting. But, as the entire world has experienced over the past two years, we have all changed. None of us can say that we are the same people that we were seven years ago, even a year ago, for that," he continued.</p><p>"Our goals and what we want out of life have changed ... But my life is different. My passions are different. My heart is different. And I'm ready for the next adventure," he added. "And that is what we are doing. We are going to follow our hearts."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmoZeqsq15wKebZqCfobm6</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
