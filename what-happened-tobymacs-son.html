The artist — whose real name is Toby McKeehan — has had 20 singles on the Billboard Christians Song List, and he was a member of the Christian rap trio DC Talk. In addition to putting out content about having faith, TobyMac is extremely family-oriented.&nbsp;</p><p>He and wife Amanda McKeehan married in 1994 and the pair shares five kids together, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">son Truett</a>, who wanted to pursue a rap career.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened to TobyMac's son</a> Truett? The Christian singer opened up about what happened to his son in an emotional statement on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to TobyMac's son?</h2><p>TobyMac confirmed that his son, who had been going by the stage name Truett Foster, passed away on Oct. 23. According to the Nashville Police and Fire Department, the 21-year-old was found unresponsive at the home he was staying in. When authorities arrived to the residence at around 11 a.m., Truett was allegedly in cardiac arrest. He was dead upon their arrival.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Truett Foster Mckeehan had joy that took the room when he entered. He was a magnetic son and brother and friend. If you met him, you knew him, you remembered him. His smile, his laugh, the encouragement he offered with words or even without. He had an untamable grand personality and dreams to match. And he hated being put in a box. He expressed himself through the music he made. And by made I mean, written, recorded, produced, mixed, and designed the art. All of it. A true artist. His first show was a week ago, and it was nothing short of electric. Everyone felt it, everyone knew it. He could’ve easily taken the easy route and put music out when he was 12, 14, 16, even 18, but he always said he wanted to live some life and have something to say before he did it. He didn’t want to be a child star, he wanted to be a man with scars and a story to tell. I always admired, respected and encouraged that stand. Truett always had a soft spot for God. The Bible moved him. His heart was warm to the things of his King. He was by no means a cookie cutter Christian but give me a believer who fights to keep believing. Give me a broken man who recognizes his need for a Savior every time. That’s who Truett was and how he should be remembered. My last moment with Truett in person was at his first show this past Thursday at the Factory in Franklin, Tennessee. I had to leave the next morning very early to fly and start our Canadian tour. As I stood in the audience and watched my son bring joy to a room, I was as proud as a “pop” (as tru called me) could be. It was the culminating moment of a dream that he had since he was 12. It couldn’t have been sweeter. Our music, and what we say lyrically couldn’t be more different, but the outcome was much the same… offering a room full of people a few minutes of joy in a crazy world. Our last text exchange is shared above (swipe). My wife and I would want the world to know this... We don’t follow God because we have some sort of under-the-table deal with Him, like, we’ll follow you if you bless us. We follow God because we love Him. It’s our honor. He is the God of the hills and the valleys. And He is beautiful above all things.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>TobyMac</a> (@tobymac) on Oct 24, 2019 at 2:26pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>TobyMac's representative did confirm the news of Truett's passing soon after&nbsp;in a brief statement.

The album's arguably most emotional song, "Scars," was based on his changing relationship to Truett, he said. &nbsp;</p><p>“I had a few people in mind when I wrote it, but subconsciously I started focusing on Truett, my firstborn son, talking to him a little about what life is throwing at him," he told Billboard Magazine when he released the album. "I wanted him to know that he’s not alone when the world might get the best of him from time to time. When he looks up and he’s got some scars, I wanted him to know that we all face those things and that he’s not alone in it.”</p><p>He also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tennessean </a>that the song showed the shift in his relationship to Truett. As Truett got older and was becoming more independent, it was hard for TobyMac to let go and allow his son to face hardships on his own.</p><p>Our thoughts are with TobyMac and his family at this incredibly difficult time. Truett leaves behind his parents and four siblings, Marlee, Moses, Leo, and Judah.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqJmypZGYwG6%2Fzqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
