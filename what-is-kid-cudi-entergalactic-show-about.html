Viewers have been treated to new productions like Wendell & Wild and The Watcher, as well as renewals of fan favorites like Stranger Things and The Witcher. Oftentimes, the actors involved in the series get their chance to take the lead by either writing, directing, or producing some episodes of the series they are a part of or even the film they are working on.One project that has caught the attention of many is Kid Cudi's Entergalactic, which follows Jabari and Meadow, and the potential that a relationship between the two can have. Entergalactic is a feast for the eyes and really allows Kid Cudi to flex his creativity not only within music, which he is the most well-known for, but also in a more behind-the-scenes and hands-on way with this project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=entergalactic-features-voice-acting-by-several-a-listers>Entergalactic Features Voice Acting By Several A-Listers</h2><p>Both Netflix and Kid Cudi likely have no issues getting whoever they want in on a project, and Entergalactic has the cast to prove it. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quick peek at the IMDb page</a> lists several well-known names within the acting and hip-hop community, and the actors look like the characters.</p><p>Kid Cudi himself does the voice of Jabari, the show's main protagonist and male lead. Jessica Williams, best known for her roles in the Fantastic Beasts films, plays Jabari's love interest Meadow.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Kid Cudi Doesn't Think He'll Be Friends With Kanye West Again">Kid Cudi Doesn't Think He'll Be Friends With Kanye West Again</a></span></p><p>Prominent names in hip-hop like Ty Dolla $ign, Teyana Taylor, and 070 Shake all make appearances in the animated special. While all three have ties to Kanye West, and Kid Cudi has made it clear that he is <a href=#>no longer friends with Ye</a>, that did not stop Cudi from bringing them on for this project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ty Dolla $ign plays one of Jabari's close friends Ky, Shake appears as Nadia, and Teyana does the voice of the boxing instructor. Jaden Smith also makes an appearance as Jordan, a young BMX star with his own unique perspective on what love is.</p><p>Timothee Chalamet plays Jabari's other friend, Jimmy, alongside Ky. Laura Harrier, best known for playing Liz in Spider-Man: Homecoming, plays Carmen, Jabari's ex-girlfriend who clearly is not over him. Vanessa Hudgens plays Karina, Meadow's very pregnant friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who is often giving her advice on the situationship with Jabari</a>.</p><p>Macauly Culkin makes a cameo in Entergalactic as Downtown Pat, the quintessential stoner character who hangs out at the skate park. Legend Keith David does the voice of Mr. Rager, a character made up by Jabari that he graffitis all over the city.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other actors included in the animated feature are Kenya Barris, Luis Guzman, and Christopher Abbott.</p><h2 id=kid-cudi-supplies-the-music-and-creative-vision-for-the-netflix-special>Kid Cudi Supplies The Music And Creative Vision For The Netflix Special</h2><p>Kid Cudi truly lets his artistic abilities shine throughout Entergalactic. While he obviously supplies the voice for the main character Jabari, he also had the opportunity to create the story and script Entergalactic, as is apparent by his writing credits on the "series" (it hasn't been split into seasons at the time of writing).</p><p>Cudi is also listed as one of the executive producers of the project, and all of his credits appear under his legal name, Scott Mescudi. The special also has an accompanying album under the same name in which all but one song has writing credits tied to Kid Cudi, with all but one song produced by him as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Ariana Grande's New Song With Kid Cudi Is Giving Serious Wedding Vibes">Ariana Grande's New Song With Kid Cudi Is Giving Serious Wedding Vibes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Entergalactic officially marks Kid Cudi's eighth studio album and features additional producers assisting him with the album's conception like Skrillex, <a href=#>who is well known for doing many collaborations with several artists</a>, Dot Da Genius, and Steve Aoki.</p><p>The album is clearly the brainchild of Kid Cudi and features his signature sound, which is nothing short of essentially being cinematic score music. Cudi as a musical artist does a fantastic job at taking his listeners on a journey through sound, almost like vividly "seeing" colors while listening.</p><p>Fans of Cudi will instantly recognize his unique flow and vocals, and his iconic melodic humming that makes an appearance in many of his songs past and present.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=entergalactic-is-a-hit-with-fans-and-critics-alike>Entergalactic Is A Hit With Fans And Critics Alike</h2><p>Usually, releases have mixed reviews and the critics and general viewers don't always see eye to eye, but Entergalactic is an exception to this rule, with Rotten Tomatoes showing an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">average 96% critic score and a 95% audience score</a>. The musical also has an incredible 9/10 on IGN.</p><p>Fans of both Cudi and the special are flooding comments sections on Rotten Tomatoes and Instagram praising the series, its music, the visual art, which is very similar to the Spider-man: Into The Spiderverse film, and the casting choices made.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="15 Celebrities Kanye West Has Feuded With">15 Celebrities Kanye West Has Feuded With</a></span></p><p>Audience reviews are calling it a "super dope love story", with others commenting how they keep taking screenshots of the visuals in the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others have gone so far as to call it the best film of 2022 and a "date night approved" movie, with many already begging for a sequel to the first part, which is a possibility with the promotional shot also calling it "season one" of Entergalactic.</p><p>Entergalactic is definitely not a traditional love story, as it explores the idea of lovingly letting each other go so that the other can grow and thrive on their own, before potentially coming back together at a better time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecqim2abpZm2brHNrZyrn5GhrqTAyJxkrKCfrHqirs6uq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
