Recommended Videos However, thanks to the network’s expert casting and refreshing take on life in the Big Apple, RHONY’s current season has largely delivered on all the staples of compelling Housewifery, from lavish new castmates like Jenna Lyons, to arguments about cheese platters and quarrels over the correct time to serve shakshuka for breakfast."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fittingly for the creative, Chelsea is home to some of NYC’s best art galleries, which might explain why Taank welcomed trendsetting guests like Vogue editor Lynn Yaeger to her home in the latest episode. Taank described Chelsea as “one of [her] favorite areas in the city.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does Jessel Taank’s apartment look like?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Upon the season fourteen premiere of RHONY, Taank took Bravo on a tour of her Chelsea apartment, which was built in 1887. The building was once used as a dried goods emporium, but now houses Taank’s neutral-colored apartment with panoramic views of the city. Taank designed the apartment herself, including a walk-in closet befitting a fashion mogul.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where do Jessel Taank’s castmates live?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=false>Taank’s description of Tribeca as an “up and coming” neighbourhood with “potential” attracted the most ire from Lichey, which is understandable given that she is a real estate agent and Tribeca resident.
