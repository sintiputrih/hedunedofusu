“The pieces reflect [Daenerys’] character — bold, rebellious, beautiful,” Clapton told Pret-a-Reporter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The queen, played by <b>Emilia Clarke</b>, is “a character that sort of appeals to both men and women. They’re both drawn to her. She’s so beautiful, and yet complicated and dynamic. She just seemed to be the perfect vehicle to launch the collection around.”</p><p>Although the series is based in a fantasy world, the pieces work for real-life women too. “I think that in the collection we have these huge statement pieces that can be worn many ways. They can be dressed up with&nbsp;evening wear. Or they can be worn in an edgy way with attitude and strength. That’s the&nbsp;way that I’d like to see them, as we have in the pictures. We’ve also made some understated pieces for people that don’t want to shout about them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To shop MEY’s <i>Game of Thrones</i> collection, visit <a href=#>Mey.London</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6y1pr7EZquoZZaeu6V5xpqknmWfm3q1tNGopZ6rXZ%2ByuLHLq7BmoqWowW64yKScZqyYmnqstMClnJ6rmah6uH6Qa2lsaF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
