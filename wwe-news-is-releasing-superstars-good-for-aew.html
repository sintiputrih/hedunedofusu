The company has released Malcolm Bivens, Dakota Kai, Dexter Lumis, Persia Pirotta, Harland, Draco Anthony, Raelyn Divine, Mila Malani, Sanjana George, and Paige Prinzivalli this week and releases has brought in a lot of questions in the minds of the fans and the other superstars as to why the superstars were being released even when some ongoing storylines could be affected due to that.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Could AEW get an edge over WWE after recent set of WWE NXT releases?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>While WWE is the greatest sports entertainment company in the world currently, the Vince McMahon led company has faced a lot of competition from Tony Khan led AEW lately. AEW has made a lot of headlines since they made their presence felt in the sports entertainment industry and has been a huge concern for the company as well.</p><p>A lot of releases made by the company have found a spot in AEW and have made themselves get counted in the list of top superstars of the company but WWE has not been concerned with that. Some of the biggest names that switched to AEW due to releases of personal reasons are Jon Moxley, Bryan Danielson, FTR, Malakai Black and many more which also brought a lot of spotlight to the Tony Khan led company.</p><p>But this shouldn’t concern <a href=#>WWE</a> thanks to the inevitable history they have and numerous legends in the corner who are still able to return for another match which should rather be a concern for AEW and their position in the wrestling industry. Though both the companies have taken some shots at each other as well, for WWE, it is not a very huge issue that should concern them.</p><p>ALSO READ: <a href=# data-type=post data-id=508868>WWE News Roundup: Numerous superstars released, Wrestlemania Backlash main event changed and more | April 30, 2022</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571rCcZqaVrMButdJmqZ6klZbAqrrGZqquqJWnwLWt0axkoKefmXqnu9FmmJ6vXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
