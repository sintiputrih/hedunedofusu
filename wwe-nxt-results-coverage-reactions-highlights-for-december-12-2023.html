He reveals that he knows who attacked Trick and that it’s the same person who attacked him.</p><p>Ilja Dragunov seems perplexed and unsure of what’s happening, while Hayes goes on to accuse Ilja of being the attacker. Hayes suggests that Ilja gains more by keeping them separated and implies that Ilja’s earlier comments were meant to create division between them and secure his control.</p><p>Ilja, maintaining his innocence, denies attacking Hayes and questions what Hayes is trying to create with these accusations.
