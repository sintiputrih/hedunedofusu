It was also very fun to remember some of the cries from older generations.<p>Here are some of my favorite cries:</p><p>GARDEVOIR - it sounds like it is singing, and it is a very pleasing sound.<br>JYNX - probably one of the funniest cries every. Another singing, but much more comedic.<br>KRICKETUNE - 'Nuff said. Who DOESN'T like the strange and extremely long cry of this Mon?<br>GROOKEY - An extremely cute cry. So fitting.<br>MAREEP - It sounds like it is saying "mareeep", as a sheep would if it would be able to talk. So funny.<br>AMAURA / AURORUS - Both cries are very majestic and unique.<br>DELPHOX - It sounds like it is screaming, but in a very comedic form (it could also be screaming mixed with laughing...). Also very unique cry.<br>SCOLIPEDE / GIGALITH - I put them together not because they sound similar (akin to Charizard and Rhyhorn), but because both sound SO COOL, like they're big dinosaurs growling.<br>GIGANTAMAX MEOWTH - I don't know why, but this one cracks me up every time I hear it. "Miao Miao Miaoooo". Also the fact that it sounds just like anime Meowth is amazing.<br>CHINGLING - Awww, this sounds just like a Christmas bell (so fitting), and I love it for this!!! I most certainly am a fan of Christmas.<br>HONCHKROW - While it sounds a bit like a generic bird, it does sound like he's THE boss, as he should. I can't explain this better, I just feel like he is a honcho with his cry.<br>GLACEON - Another extremely adorable cry for an extremely adorable Pokemon. I just love how adorable Glaceon is all around. Maybe Stufful's cry is objectively more adorable, but I chose Glaceon for how cute it is.</p><p>So, which are yours? It can be because it sounds awesome and intimidating, adorable, very funny, unique, o just because you just like the sound and find it memorable.<br>Thanks for reading.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy6u9SrZJ%2BZpqS%2FqsDEZqeoo5WivK95wqugnqtdm7%2BwuYytn55ll5a6pr%2BNa29pcWFlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
